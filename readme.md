Welcome to the repo where all my daily coding attempts, accidental bugs, heroic fixes, and questionable decisions end up living together like an overcrowded hostel.

Inside you'll find:

- Assignments I finished minutes before submission  
- DSA problems I swore I'd never do again  
- Random files whose purpose even I have forgotten  
- And the occasional code that actually works (rare collectible)

This repo isn’t organized.  
It’s a timeline of my suffering.

Browse responsibly.

** P.S. I’m also learning AI in another repo — because why ruin only one part of my life when I can ruin two. **
