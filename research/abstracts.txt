1. ACE: A Static Android Malware Detection Method Based on Supervised Contrastive Learning
Abstract:
Smart and mobile devices are essential components of the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems, facilitating connectivity and automation across various domains. Due to its flexibility, the Android operating system is widely adopted in these devices. However, their increasing integration into IoT networks has introduced significant security risks, particularly from Android malware. To address these challenges, effective detection methods are needed to enhance IoT security. Given the success of contrastive learning in computer vision, researchers have increasingly explored its potential for Android malware detection. This article presents a static Android malware detection method that integrates deep learning with supervised contrastive learning. Based on the characteristic that contrastive learning enhances the model’s ability to effectively represent input samples, we design a novel contrastive loss based on structural similarity metrics and integrate it with contractive loss and binary cross-entropy loss to construct a hierarchical loss function for guiding model optimization. Furthermore, the method directly analyzes the classes.dex file from Android application package, eliminating the need for feature engineering or domain expertise, thus enhancing its applicability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an 87.13% F1-score on the AndroZoo dataset, outperforming baseline models while maintaining computational efficiency and practical usability. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the hierarchical loss function in improving model performance and ensuring consistent malware representation within the same family.

3. Enhanced Consistency Bi-directional GAN(CBiGAN) for Malware Anomaly Detection
Abstract:
Static analysis, a cornerstone technique in cybersecurity, offers a noninvasive method for detecting malware by analyzing dormant software without executing potentially harmful code. However, traditional static analysis often relies on biased or outdated datasets, leading to gaps in detection capabilities against emerging malware threats. To address this, our study focuses on the binary content of files as key features for malware detection. These binary contents are transformed and represented as images, which then serve as inputs to deep learning models. This method takes into account the visual patterns within the binary data, allowing the model to analyze potential malware effectively. This paper introduces the application of the CBiGAN in the domain of malware anomaly detection. Our approach leverages the CBiGAN for its superior latent space mapping capabilities, critical for modeling complex malware patterns by utilizing a reconstruction error-based anomaly detection method. We utilized several datasets including both portable executable (PE) files as well as Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) files. We then evaluated our model against a diverse set of both PE and OLE files, including self-collected malicious executables from 214 malware families. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of this innovative approach, with the CBiGAN achieving high Area Under the Curve (AUC) results with good generalizability, thereby confirming its capability to distinguish between benign and diverse malicious files with reasonably high accuracy.

36. Through the Static: Demystifying Malware Visualization via Explainability
Abstract:
Security researchers grapple with the surge of malicious files, necessitating swift identification and classification of malware strains for effective protection. Visual classifiers and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as vital tools for this task. However, issues of robustness and explainability, common in other high risk domain like medicine and autonomous vehicles, remain understudied in current literature. Although deep learning visualization classifiers presented in research obtain great results without the need for expert feature extraction, they have not been properly studied in terms of their replicability. Additionally, the literature is not clear on how these types of classifiers arrive to their answers. Our study addresses these gaps by replicating six CNN models and exploring their pitfalls. We employ Class Activation Maps (CAMs), like GradCAM and HiResCAM, to assess model explainability. We evaluate the CNNs' performance and interpretability on two standard datasets, MalImg and Big2015, and a newly created called VX-Zoo. We employ these different CAM techniques to gauge the explainability of each of the models. With these tools, we investigate the underlying factors contributing to different interpretations of inputs across the different models, empowering human researchers to discern patterns crucial for identifying distinct malware families and explain why CNN models arrive at their conclusions. Other then highlighting the patterns found in the interpretability study, we employ the extracted heatmpas to enhance Visual Transformers classifiers' performance and explanation quality. This approach yields substantial improvements in F1 score, ranging from 2% to 8%, across the datasets compared to benchmark values.

Notably, we observed almost no gains in performance beyond a dataset size of 1.5 million records, challenging the notion that larger datasets always equate to better models in malware detection. Furthermore, we investigated machine learning models’ ability to detect zero-day attacks, showing that machine learning techniques offer robust and adaptive solutions for IoT intrusion detection, even in the face of emerging malware attacks.

48. ClarAVy: A Tool for Scalable and Accurate Malware Family Labeling
Abstract:
Determining the family to which a malicious file belongs is an essential component of cyberattack investigation, attribution, and remediation. Performing this task manually is time consuming and requires expert knowledge. Automated tools using that label malware using antivirus detections lack accuracy and/or scalability, making them insufficient for real-world applications. Three pervasive shortcomings in these tools are responsible: (1) incorrect parsing of antivirus detections, (2) errors during family alias resolution, and (3) an inappropriate antivirus aggregation strategy. To address each of these, we created our own malware family labeling tool called ClarAVy. ClarAVy utilizes a Variational Bayesian approach to aggregate detections from a collection of antivirus products into accurate family labels. Our tool scales to enormous malware datasets, and we evaluated it by labeling ?40 million malicious files. ClarAVy has 8 and 12 percentage points higher accuracy than the prior leading tool in labeling the MOTIF and MalPedia datasets, respectively.

56. Machine Learning Approach to Malware Classification Using Byte N-Grams on IoT Devices
Abstract:
Malware for IoT devices has become popular in recent years. Many detection methods have been proposed to detect the malware, mainly using machine learning, but they are not designed to work on IoT devices and are often implemented using Python. Running a Python program requires the installation of a package, which is impractical given the memory and storage size of IoT devices. In addition, methods that require decompilation, static and dynamic analysis of test samples are difficult to run on IoT devices. Therefore, in this research, we propose a method implemented in C/C++ so that malware detection using byte n-grams and machine learning can be run on IoT devices, and then resource consumption can be measured. Byte n-gram methods are good approaches to detect malware without knowing the execution environment. Moreover, the Top-L approach to information gain can be effectively applied to reduce storage and memory consumption. As a result of the evaluation, when using an SVM model with Top-50000 that maintains effective classification accuracy, the memory consumption was 71.91MB and the storage consumption was 1.3GB, which can be implemented in IoT devices.

Abstract:
Malware presents formidable challenges to digital security, underscoring the need for robust detection mechanisms to counter potential cyber threats. Relying solely on a single model for detection, however, comes with limitations in accurately capturing the complexity and variability of malware samples. In response, this study introduces a novel ensemble method for malware classification, harnessing the combined strengths of multiple deep learning models to bolster detection accuracy and resilience. Through meticulous fine-tuning of established pre-trained models like MobileNetV1, MobileNetV2, and Xception, we integrate their predictive capabilities using a stack ensemble framework. This ensemble approach aggregates decisions from the three models through a stacking technique, yielding outcomes characterized by high generalizability and minimal variance. Our methodology innovatively avoids the necessity for conventional techniques such as feature engineering and other domain-specific methods traditionally employed in malware classification. Our model's efficacy is rigorously assessed on the Malimg dataset, encompassing 9,335 images spanning 25 distinct classes. Demonstrating superior performance compared to individual models, our approach achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 98.35% on the Malimg dataset. Additionally, statistical analyses, including McNemar's test, substantiate the significance of our findings. Comparative evaluations against existing methods further underscore the efficacy of our proposed ensemble approach in effectively detecting malware instances.

84. MVC-RSN: A Malware Classification Method With Variant Identification Ability
Abstract:
With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), a substantial number of mobile devices may need to be connected to and communicate with the other devices. IoT smart nodes, which play a key role in these processes, provide not only connectivity but also data security during data collection and transmission. While existing research has considered security issues concerning data collection and transmission to some extent, the inherent vulnerabilities of smart nodes themselves have rarely received adequate attention. Actually, smart nodes can be susceptible to malware attacks, and the fundamental task to protect them is the timely and accurate identification of malware. However, the stealthy nature of malware, the imbalance in its types, and the sharp increase in malware variants make this task challenging. Existing static malware classification methods, which require known malware features, may struggle with a whole new set of malware variants. Dynamic methods plausibly have the potential to identify malware variants but necessitate running malware beforehand. In this article, we propose a deep-learning-based malware classification method designed to help most smart IoT nodes running mainstream operating systems preventing attacks from the malware and its variants. The proposed method incorporates an automatically adjusting threshold mechanism to extract trivial features of malware, refining the classification process even if original features are modified. It also performs well with insufficient malware samples and is compatible with most mainstream convolutional neural network (CNN) models allowing flexible implements. Experiments concerning byte-level variants, operation-code-level variants, and noise-caused variants are conducted. The results show that for the malware files and their variants, the proposed method can accurately accomplish the malware classification tasks. In addition, the proposed method offers a robust solution for the malware classification, which helps to enhance the security of smart nodes against a wide range of malware and its variants. Last but not least, its compatibility with mainstream CNN models and flexibility in deployment make it a practical approach for real-world applications.

85. Assessing the Impact of Packing on Machine Learning-Based Malware Detection and Classification Systems
Abstract:
The proliferation of malware, particularly through the use of packing, presents a significant challenge to static analysis and signature-based malware detection techniques. The application of packing to the original executable code renders extracting meaningful features and signatures challenging. To deal with the increasing amount of malware in the wild, researchers and anti-malware companies started harnessing machine learning capabilities with very promising results. However, little is known about the effects of packing on static machine learning-based malware detection and classification systems. This work addresses this gap by investigating the impact of packing on the performance of static machine learning-based models used for malware detection and classification, with a particular focus on those using visualisation techniques. To this end, we present a comprehensive analysis of various packing techniques and their effects on the performance of machine learning-based detectors and classifiers. Our findings highlight the limitations of current static detection and classification systems and underscore the need to be proactive to effectively counteract the evolving tactics of malware authors.

109. Malicious program detection using distinct textural features and fine-tuned InceptionV3 model
Abstract:
Various prevalent malware detection methods employ static signature-based detection, dynamic analysis, and other techniques to identify malware. However, these traditional malware detection techniques have become less effective due to sophisticated evasion techniques employed by malware authors. In addition, malware analysis is a highly compute-intensive process. This research introduces a new malware detection architecture that deploys different textural features and transfer learning. In this approach, the entire binary executable program is first converted into a grayscale image before extracting the deep textural features by taking the whole image as input to the convolution neural network (CNN) model. Subsequently, a pre-trained InceptionV3 model is used to extract the textural characteristics of the visualized image. The dimension of feature maps is reduced by customizing the InceptionV3 model and adding fully connected (FC) dense layers. This study performs the feature correlation analysis to select only highly distinct textural features. Finally, the selected feature map trains a softmax classifier to predict unknown malware families. This study conducts the experiments using two well-known public benchmarked datasets-MalImg and Microsoft BIG. The proposed model reported a classification accuracy of $98.57 \%$ using the MalIng data set and an accuracy of $97.78 \%$ for the Microsoft data set. The proposed model is superior to similar approaches in the literature. The minimal computation cost of feature extraction makes it well-suited for malware threat detection in industrial environments.

114. PromptSAM+: Malware Detection based on Prompt Segment Anything Model
Abstract:
Machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) have been extensively applied in malware detection, and some existing methods demonstrate robust performance. However, several issues persist in the field of malware detection: (1) Existing work often overemphasizes accuracy at the expense of practicality, rarely considering false positive and false negative rates as important metrics. (2) Considering the evolution of malware, the performance of classifiers significantly declines over time, greatly reducing the practicality of malware detectors. (3) Prior ML/DL-based efforts heavily rely on ample labeled data for model training, largely dependent on feature engineering or domain knowledge to build feature databases, making them vulnerable if correct labels are scarce. With the development of computer vision, vision-based malware detection technology has also rapidly evolved. In this paper, we propose a visual malware general enhancement classification framework, `PromptSAM+', based on a large visual network segmentation model, the Prompt Segment Anything Model(named PromptSAM+). Our experimental results indicate that 'PromptSAM+' is effective and efficient in malware detection and classification, achieving high accuracy and low rates of false positives and negatives. The proposed method outperforms the most advanced image-based malware detection technologies on several datasets. 'PromptSAM+' can mitigate aging in existing image-based malware classifiers, reducing the considerable manpower needed for labeling new malware samples through active learning. We conducted experiments on datasets for both Windows and Android platforms, achieving favorable outcomes. Additionally, our ablation experiments on several datasets demonstrate that our model identifies effective modules within the large visual network.

Abstract:
The tremendous growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has gained a lot of attention in the global market. The massive deployment of IoT is also inherent in various security vulnerabilities, which become easy targets for hackers. IoT botnets are one type of critical malware that degrades the performance of the IoT network and is difficult to detect by end-users. Although there are several traditional IoT botnet mitigation techniques such as access control, data encryption, and secured device configuration, these traditional mitigation techniques are difficult to apply due to normal traffic behavior, similar packet transmission, and the repetitive nature of IoT network traffic. Motivated by botnet obfuscation, this article proposes an intelligent mitigation technique for IoT botnets, named IMTIBoT. Using this technique, we harnessed the stacking of ensemble classifiers to build an intelligent system. This stacking classifier technique was tested using an experimental testbed of IoT nodes and sensors. This system achieved an accuracy of 0.984, with low latency.

137. TexIm FAST: Text-to-Image Representation for Semantic Similarity Evaluation using Transformers
Abstract:
One of the principal objectives of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is to generate meaningful representations from text. Improving the informativeness of the representations has led to a tremendous rise in the dimensionality and the memory footprint. It leads to a cascading effect amplifying the complexity of the downstream model by increasing its parameters. The available techniques cannot be applied to cross-modal applications such as text-to-image. To ameliorate these issues, a novel Text-to-Image methodology for generating fixed-length representations through a self-supervised Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) for semantic evaluation applying transformers (TexIm FAST) has been proposed in this paper. The pictorial representations allow oblivious inference while retaining the linguistic intricacies, and are potent in cross-modal applications. TexIm FAST deals with variable-length sequences and generates fixed-length representations with over 75% reduced memory footprint. It enhances the efficiency of the models for downstream tasks by reducing its parameters. The efficacy of TexIm FAST has been extensively analyzed for the task of Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) upon the MSRPC, CNN/ Daily Mail, and XSum data-sets. The results demonstrate 6% improvement in accuracy compared to the baseline and showcase its exceptional ability to compare disparate length sequences such as a text with its summary.

Abstract:
The introduction of transformers has been an important breakthrough for AI research and application as transformers are the foundation behind Generative AI. A promising application domain for transformers is cybersecurity, in particular the malware domain analysis. The reason is the flexibility of the transformer models in handling long sequential features and understanding contextual relationships. However, as the use of transformers for malware analysis is still in the infancy stage, it is critical to evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing literature to foster future research. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of transformer-based approaches designed for malware analysis. Based on our systematic analysis of existing knowledge, we structure and propose taxonomies based on: (a) how different transformers are adapted, organized, and modified across various use cases; and (b) how diverse feature types and their representation capabilities are reflected. We also provide an inventory of datasets used to explore multiple research avenues in the use of transformers for malware analysis and discuss open challenges with future research directions. We believe that this SoK paper will assist the research community in gaining detailed insights from existing work and will serve as a foundational resource for implementing novel research using transformers for malware analysis.

157. Malware Detector Based On Enhanced Vision Transformer
Abstract:
With the increasing use of automated generation tools, new malicious code variants are being generated at an alarming rate. To combat this, cybersecurity experts use static and dynamic analysis methods to analyze these variants. Static analysis entails examining disassembled code without running the malicious samples, whereas dynamic analysis involves scrutinizing behavioral data by executing samples within a controlled virtual environment. While both approaches have their pros and cons, static analysis proves more advantageous when it comes to handling extensive volumes of malware. This paper outlines the variances between static and dynamic analysis approaches, elucidates the process of extracting raw features in static analysis, and highlights the prevalent inclination towards static analysis when dealing with substantial volumes of malware. The applicability of the proposed framework is confirmed through the validation of diverse benchmark datasets. The suggested approach demonstrated superior performance, achieving an accuracy rate of 99.35% on the Malimg dataset.

This allows us to use more features from the data, hence giving to the algorithm more information, without having to increase the number of qubits that we use for the quantum circuit. This approach is motivated by the fact that we do not always have great amounts of data, and that quantum computers are currently restricted in their number of logical qubits.

Abstract:
The widespread integration of embedded systems across various industries has facilitated seamless connectivity among devices and bolstered computational capabilities. Despite their extensive applications, embedded systems encounter significant security threats, with one of the most critical vulnerabilities being malicious software, commonly known as malware. In recent times, malware detection techniques leveraging Machine Learning have gained popularity. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven particularly efficient in image processing tasks. However, one major drawback of neural network architectures is their substantial computational resource requirements. Continuous training of malware detection models with updated malware and benign samples demands immense computational resources, presenting a challenge for real-world applications. In response to these concerns, we propose a Processing-in-Memory (PIM)-based architecture to mitigate memory access latency, thereby reducing the resources consumed during model updates. To further enhance throughput and minimize energy consumption, we incorporate precision scaling techniques tailored for CNN models. Our proposed PIM architecture exhibits a 1.09x higher throughput compared to existing Lookup Table (LUT)-based PIM architectures. Additionally, precision scaling combined with PIM enhances energy efficiency by 1.5x compared to full-precision operations, without sacrificing performance. This innovative approach offers a promising solution to the resource-intensive nature of malware detection model updates, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable cybersecurity practices.

163. Transfer learning based multi-class malware classification using VGG16 feature extractor and SVM classifier
Abstract:
Malicious programs are becoming a severe problem in today’s internet-connected world. Several works have explored image analysis-based malware detection in recent years. The image analysis method converts the malicious code into gray-scale images, which enables the use of deep learning models in the domain of malware detection. This paper proposes a new architecture using a fine-tuned Visual Geometry Group(VGG16) model with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to achieve high-performance accuracy in detecting and classifying evolving malware. At first, the malicious code is represented in gray-scale images, which are further reshaped and resized to be fed into a fine-tuned VGG16 model as end-to-end feature extraction with the least dependence on human-crafted feature engineering. The extracted textural feature maps are further correlated to remove the highly correlated features before using them to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The experiments are performed on public bench-marked MalImg datasets and actual malware samples. The VGG 16+ SVM model obtained 99.25% classification accuracy for the MalImg and 80.29% for real-world malware, which signifies that the model can detect real-world instances of malware. The proposed method outperforms similar existing works and is suitable for deployment in an IoT environment due to the least cost involved in feature engineering.

165. Generative AI-Based Effective Malware Detection for Embedded Computing Systems
Abstract:
One of the pivotal security threats for the embedded computing systems is malicious software a.k.a malware. With efficiency and efficacy, Machine Learning (ML) has been widely adopted for malware detection in recent times. Despite being efficient, the existing techniques require a tremendous number of benign and malware samples for training and modeling an efficient malware detector. Furthermore, such constraints limit the detection of emerging malware samples due to the lack of sufficient malware samples required for efficient training. To address such concerns, we introduce a code-aware data generation technique that generates multiple mutated samples of the limitedly seen malware by the devices. Loss minimization ensures that the generated samples closely mimic the limitedly seen malware and mitigate the impractical samples. Such developed malware is further incorporated into the training set to formulate the model that can efficiently detect the emerging malware despite having limited exposure. The experimental results demonstrates that the proposed technique achieves an accuracy of 90% in detecting limitedly seen malware, which is approximately 3x more than the accuracy attained by state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract:
Malware visualized images are increasingly being used to evade detection by traditional malware detection systems. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep transfer learning method for the detection and classification of Malware colored images. This paper presents a visualized RGB malware detection approach that employs a hybrid autoencoder for anomaly detection along with transfer deep learning for feature extraction. The proposed model first processes RGB images of malware samples, which are reconstructed using a hybrid autoencoder to highlight anomalies between normal and malicious code. Then, it uses a combination of deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures and the transfer learning approach to leverage the power of pre-trained models to extract features. The pre-trained models are then fine-tuned on the target dataset, which enables more efficient learning of image features than from scratch while reducing the risk of overfitting. Then, these architectures are ensembled to improve the system’s accuracy and robustness in detecting malware threats. The proposed approach has been evaluated on a benchmark dataset for malware detection. The results show that the autoencoder algorithm is successful in identifying the outliers data. The Hybrid Ensemble Deep Transfer Learning (HEDTL) model outperforms individual architectures, with a higher detection rate and lower false positive rate, resulting in improved accuracy in detecting and preventing malware threats.

172. A Robust CNN for Malware Classification against Executable Adversarial Attack
Abstract:
Deep-learning-based malware-detection models are threatened by adversarial attacks. This paper designs a robust and secure convolutional neural network (CNN) for malware classification. First, three CNNs with different pooling layers, including global average pooling (GAP), global max pooling (GMP), and spatial pyramid pooling (SPP), are proposed. Second, we designed an executable adversarial attack to construct adversarial malware by changing the meaningless and unimportant segments within the Portable Executable (PE) header file. Finally, to consolidate the GMP-based CNN, a header-aware loss algorithm based on the attention mechanism is proposed to defend the executive adversarial attack. The experiments showed that the GMP-based CNN achieved better performance in malware detection than other CNNs with around 98.61% accuracy. However, all CNNs were vulnerable to the executable adversarial attack and a fast gradient-based attack with a 46.34% and 34.65% accuracy decline on average, respectively. Meanwhile, the improved header-aware CNN achieved the best performance with an evasion ratio of less than 5.0%.

174. Identification of optimal hyperspectral wavelength to discriminate maize and sorghum crops using AVIRIS-NG data in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh, India
Abstract:
In this study, we utilized AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data captured during the Rabi season in February 2018 in a region of Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh, where Maize and Sorghum crops are extensively cultivated. Despite having parallel crop calendars and spectral similarities, distinguishing between Maize and Sorghum crops during similar vegetative growth stages poses a challenge. The high spectral resolution of AVIRIS-NG data allows for precise identification of subtle changes in the objects under study. The key finding of our research is the identification of sensitive spectral bands within specific wavelength regions that facilitate the differentiation of these two visually similar crops. Our results indicate that the spectral range from 1553 nm to 1749 nm of AVIRIS-NG data provides optimal discrimination between Sorghum and Maize crops, irrespective of their growth stages. Notably, the wavelengths at 1649 nm and 1654 nm emerge as particularly suitable for distinguishing between Maize and Sorghum crops, as indicated by statistical separability measures such as Wilks' Lambda and F-Value. At these wavelengths, we observed significant results with Wilks' Lambda values of 0.388 and 0.387, and F-Values of 39.29 and 39.46, respectively, further supporting their efficacy in crop discrimination.

178. Use of Multi-CNNs for Section Analysis in Static Malware Detection
Abstract:
Existing research on malware detection focuses almost exclusively on the detection rate. However, in some cases, it is also important to understand the results of our algorithm, or to obtain more information, such as where to investigate in the file for an analyst. In this aim, we propose a new model to analyze Portable Executable files. Our method consists in splitting the files in different sections, then transform each section into an image, in order to train convolutional neural networks to treat specifically each identified section. Then we use all these scores returned by CNNs to compute a final detection score, using models that enable us to improve our analysis of the importance of each section in the final score.

179. Building Visual Malware Dataset using VirusShare Data and Comparing Machine Learning Baseline Model to CoAtNet for Malware Classification
Abstract:
The present work takes inspiration from the work of Zihang Dai, Hanxiao Liu, Quoc V. Le, Mingxing Tan at Google Research, Brain Team about CoAtNet . In that work it was showed that it is possible to combine the strengths from both convolution and transformer architectures, by unifying convnets and self-attention into a machine learning model. We want to apply the CoAtNet to a visual dataset of malware images and compare its performances to a baseline CNN model. For this reason we need a data set of appropriate size and format. From these needs triggers the requirement to find or generate a visual dataset of the malware images capable to measure the accuracy of the constructed model. As will be seen, the creation of a new dataset will be preferred to the search for an existing dataset. Although the visual approach has already been extensively tested in recent years, there is still a need for more customised data for the model under examination. The work described in this paper can serve as a guide to a balanced and dimensioned construction of an optimal malware visual image dataset.

188. SREMIC: Spatial Relation Extraction-based Malware Image Classification
Abstract:
Around 800,000 people fall prey to cyberattacks annually, most often by “malware”. Malware has the potential to become a destructive weapon in Cyber-world. It is a difficult task to manually thwart an assault by malware. It is crucial to properly categorize malware binaries in order to identify their origins. Furthermore, malware structure discovery through basic feature extraction approaches are time-consuming and challenging. Malware classification was previously solved using naive machine learning approaches like support vector machine (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Recently, deep learning (DL) has shown to be impactful in finding malicious patterns. Without DL, analysis of the vast amounts of available data tends to impossible. Existing methods (e.g., transfer learning, fusion methodology, ensemble learning) may not be effective on actual malware binary files. Moreover, some single image-based malware classification used rudimentary convolutional neural network (CNN) that does not perform well. Faced with these challenges, we propose in this paper a novel model with of a spatial CNN with sufficient regularization and data augmentation that can identify and classify malware in images effectively and efficiently. Our model is evaluated using datasets like MalImg and Microfsoft-Big. The proposed model achieves validation score of 99.93% for MalImg and 99.72% for Microsoft-Big datasets. Our approach outperforms VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, EfficientNetB1, and Google's Inception v3, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques.

193. Enhanced Image-Based Malware Multiclass Classification Method with the Ensemble Model and SVM
Abstract:
Abstract Malware has become one of the biggest risks to security due to its rapid expansion. Therefore, it must be quickly detected and removed. While convolutional neural network (CNN) models have expanded to include ensemble and transfer learning approach from previous individual CNN architectures, relatively few studies have compared how well these approaches perform when it comes to malware family detection. A small number of malware varieties have been the focus of several research efforts’ studies. In this study, both of these issues were resolved. We present our own ensemble model for the classification of malware diseases into 34 types. We merge the Microsoft malware dataset with the Malimg dataset to increase the number of malware families identified by the model. To reduce training time and resource consumption, the suggested model utilized the most significant malware features, which are chosen based on the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator method, for the purpose of classifying the malware classes. The experimental findings demonstrate that the ensemble model’s accuracy is 99.78%. Based on the experimental results, we conclude that the model will help with real-world malware classification tasks.

Abstract:
To cope with the escalating malicious code variants, we propose a malicious code classification method (BiTCN-CA) based on bidirectional temporal convolution network (BiTCN) and channel attention (Channel Attention (CA) based malicious code classification method (BiTCN-CA). The method fuses malicious code opcode and bytecode features to show different details; and builds BiTCN models to take advantage of the backward and forward dependencies of the features; and introduces the channel attention mechanism to further explore the deep dependencies within the malicious code data. The model is validated on kaggle dataset, and the experimental results show that the classification accuracy of malicious code based on BiTCN-CA can reach 99.36% with fast convergence speed and low classification error, and finally the effectiveness of the model is proved by comparison experiment and ablation experiment.

198. A lightweight method for Android malware classification based on teacher assistant distillation
Abstract:
In recent years, the growing concern over mobile security and the associated risks posed by mobile malware have prompted an increased focus on utilizing deep learning models for analyzing Android application security. However, the expansion of deep learning model sizes results in an exponential growth of model parameters, demanding significant computing resources for execution. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight Android malware detection method based on teacher-assistant-student knowledge distillation. Our method enables predicting on local clients, eliminating the need for cloud-base service interactions, and protecting user privacy. We visualize the binary file of the target Android application as an RGB three-channel color image, using ResNeSt50 as the teacher model, and compress it based on knowledge distillation. An assistant model is incorporated to address the issue of insufficient distillation resulting from the significant gap between the teacher and student models. Additionally, we integrate a split-attention mechanism to enhance the ability of the professor model to acquire deep features of malware images. We conduct experiments on Drebin and CICMalDroid 2020 datasets and the results show that the proposed method can ensure that the detection results of student model are more similar to those of the teacher model while reducing model complexity. Our method reduces the number of model parameters by 95% compare to the teacher model while maintaining accuracy. And the accuracy is improved by 0.63% compare to the traditional distillation method.

199. A Binary Cryptographic Algorithm Identification Method Based on Complementary Features
Abstract:
Abstract—The effective identification of binary cryptographic algorithms provides crucial technical support for encryption cracking and security mechanism analysis. However, the identification of binary cryptographic algorithms faces interferences from different instruction sets, optimizations, and obfuscations in reality. To address the challenge, two mutually compensating features (one is the high-level semantic feature of cryptographic algorithm and the other is the intuitive code execution pattern extracted from binary grayscale image) are adopted in this paper. By representing binary cryptographic algorithms from different perspectives, accurate identification of cryptographic algorithms is achieved through a two-stage classification process. The proposed method outperforms the current advanced binary cryptographic algorithm identification method, GENDA, in terms of identification performance across different compilation and obfuscation scenarios.

209. A Lightweight Generative Adversarial Network for Imbalanced Malware Image Classification
Abstract:
Classifying malware images is important in cybersecurity. The nature of different families and classes of malware images is imbalanced, which leads to a challenging issue of biased classification, where the majority classes dominate the model's performance. Attention is drawn to generative artificial intelligence, in which a generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to synthesize more training samples (particularly in minority classes). A more balanced dataset can reduce biased classification towards the majority class. However, a robust GAN model usually requires high computing power and a lot of epochs. In this paper, we aim to design a lightweight GAN model to enhance the performance of malware image classification in imbalanced datasets. Performance evaluation and analysis show that it enhances the model's accuracy and reduces its training time. Future research directions are also shared.

Abstract:
A crucial part is played by malware detection and classification in ensuring the safety and security of computer systems. In this work, a comprehensive study has been presented for the classification of harmful or malware images that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which has been finely tuned and its performance has been compared with five pre-trained models: ResNet50, InceptionResNetV2, VGG16, Xception and InceptionV3. The suggested CNN framework has been trained using the dataset MalImg_9010, consisting of 9,376 grayscale images resized to 128 × 128 pixels. The models have been evaluated based on their F1 score, recall, precision, and accuracy. The experiments that were conducted demonstrate that the fine-tuned CNN model achieves an impressive 0.965 as the F1 score and a 95.57% accuracy. Furthermore, the comparison with pre-trained models reveals the dominance of the presented framework concerning the F1 score and accuracy. The output of the conducted simulation suggests that the fine-tuned CNN approach shows promise for accurate malware image classification. Additionally, the paper discusses potential improvements, such as increasing the number of training epochs and incorporating larger and more diverse malware datasets, including RGB images and a broader range of malware families. The current research article gives valuable observations on various models’ effectiveness for classifying malware images and highlights the future scopes for research incorporating this domain.

221. IMCSCL: Image-Based Malware Classification using Self-Supervised and Contrastive Learning
Abstract:
The use of malware for illicit cyber activities, including network attacks and information theft, poses a severe threat to cybersecurity. In comparison to traditional malware detection methods based on signature and heuristics, machine learning and deep learning-based malware detection methods demonstrate superior generalization ability. However, existing research still faces challenges such as reliance on relatively single malware features, inadequate ability to describe malware features, and overdependence on labeled data. In this paper, we propose an image-based malware classification method using self-supervised and contrastive learning, named IMCSCL. We visualize malware using opcode semantic features, and then detect malware using a contrastive learning method with improved feature encoder network. Experimental results demonstrate that IMCSCL achieves higher detection accuracy compared to supervised malware detection methods, achieving 98.85% accuracy on the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge dataset. Fine-tuning the model using randomly selected 5% labeled samples from the training set still achieved high accuracy of 94.22%. IMCSCL exhibits superior generalization ability, faster convergence speed, and better training stability. Moreover, contrastive learning significantly reduces malware labeling costs while effectively enhancing detection performance.

227. Burning the Adversarial Bridges: Robust Windows Malware Detection Against Binary-level Mutations
Abstract:
Toward robust malware detection, we explore the attack surface of existing malware detection systems. We conduct root-cause analyses of the practical binary-level black-box adversarial malware examples. Additionally, we uncover the sensitivity of volatile features within the detection engines and exhibit their exploitability. Highlighting volatile information channels within the software, we introduce three software pre-processing steps to eliminate the attack surface, namely, padding removal, software stripping, and inter-section information resetting. Further, to counter the emerging section injection attacks, we propose a graph-based section-dependent information extraction scheme for software representation. The proposed scheme leverages aggregated information within various sections in the software to enable robust malware detection and mitigate adversarial settings. Our experimental results show that traditional malware detection models are ineffective against adversarial threats. However, the attack surface can be largely reduced by eliminating the volatile information. Therefore, we propose simple-yet-effective methods to mitigate the impacts of binary manipulation attacks. Overall, our graph-based malware detection scheme can accurately detect malware with an area under the curve score of 88.32\% and a score of 88.19% under a combination of binary manipulation attacks, exhibiting the efficiency of our proposed scheme.

233. A Deep Learning Model for Malware Multi-Class Classification based on Colored Malware Images
Abstract:
A malicious computer program and its unique attacks have been a source of concern for decades and a major threat to the people of the cyber world. There has been a dramatic increase in malware attacks, their exploration, and the complexity of code and types, which has made malware classification very difficult. With the advent of automated strategies and tools for producing malware, a newly developed malicious program evades detection strategies. Deep Learning (DL) has gained a lot of attention, popularity, and performance in malware analysis. Although DL models reach high-performance levels, they require extensive training samples, high-resolution images, and deep DL structures. This study investigates and highlights the performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based malware classifier on colored malware images. To test the CNN model, a well-known malimg dataset was used with a classification speed of fewer than three milliseconds per step, achieving 98.394% test accuracy. The test results encourage the usage of color image processing compared to grayscale images and demonstrate good efficiency and accuracy. It emphasizes that even with basic DL structures, remarkable performance can be attained when dealing with low-dimensional images.

235. Smart OMVI: Obfuscated Malware Variant Identification using a novel dataset
Abstract:
Cybersecurity has become a significant issue in the digital era as a result of the growth in everyday computer use. Cybercriminals now engage in more than virus distribution and computer hacking. Cyberwarfare has developed as a result because it has become a threat to a nation's survival. Malware analysis serves as the first line of defence against an attack and is a significant component of cybercrime. Every day, malware attacks target a large number of computer users, businesses, and governmental agencies, causing billions of dollars in losses. Malware may evade multiple AV software with a very minor, cunning tweak made by its designers, despite the fact that security experts have a variety of tools at their disposal to identify it. To address this challenge, a new dataset called the Obfuscated Malware Dataset (OMD) has been developed. This dataset comprises 40 distinct malware families having 21924 samples, and it incorporates obfuscation techniques that mimic the strategies employed by malware creators to make their malware variations different from the original samples. The purpose of this dataset is to provide a more realistic and representative environment for evaluating the effectiveness of malware analysis techniques. Different conventional machine learning algorithms including but not limited to Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forrest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) etc are applied and contrasted. The results demonstrated that XGBoost outperformed the other algorithms, achieving an accuracy of f 82%, precision of 88%, recall of 80%, and an F1-Score of 83%.

240. Transformation of Network Flow Data into Images for Intrusion Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks
Abstract:
One of the most challenging problems in intrusion detection is the development of techniques that are able to detect novel and unseen attacks. Currently, the researchers are investigating applicability of the deep learning techniques to solve this task, as the deep learning models are known for their ability to reveal spatial as well as temporal patterns in data flows. However, their usage often requires converting tabular data to matrix-based structures. This paper presents an approach to constructing images from the raw sequence of bytes representing network flow, discusses several options to generate them, and evaluates their impact on the performance of intrusion detection model. The experiments are conducted using the CICIDS2017 dataset. The obtained results show that the proposed data preprocessing technique allows one to achieve high accuracy in attack detection, and as this approach does not require knowledge of protocol structure, it could serve as a basis for development of protocol-independent preprocessing techniques in intrusion detection tasks.

241. ViT4Mal: Lightweight Vision Transformer for Malware Detection on Edge Devices
Abstract:
There has been a tremendous growth of edge devices connected to the network in recent years. Although these devices make our life simpler and smarter, they need to perform computations under severe resource and energy constraints, while being vulnerable to malware attacks. Once compromised, these devices are further exploited as attack vectors targeting critical infrastructure. Most existing malware detection solutions are resource and compute-intensive and hence perform poorly in protecting edge devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach ViT4Mal that utilizes a lightweight vision transformer (ViT) for malware detection on an edge device. ViT4Mal first converts executable byte-code into images to learn malware features and later uses a customized lightweight ViT to detect malware with high accuracy. We have performed extensive experiments to compare our model with state-of-the-art CNNs in the malware detection domain. Experimental results corroborate that ViTs don’t demand deeper networks to achieve comparable accuracy of around 97% corresponding to heavily structured CNN models. We have also performed hardware deployment of our proposed lightweight ViT4Mal model on the Xilinx PYNQ Z1 FPGA board by applying specialized hardware optimizations such as quantization, loop pipelining, and array partitioning. ViT4Mal achieved an accuracy of ~94% and a 41x speedup compared to the original ViT model.

255. MVVDroid: Android Malware Detection based on Multi-View Visualization
Abstract:
With the increasing popularity of the Android platform, more and more malicious apps have been released, threatening the security of mobile users. As they have complex logic and diverse variations, each of the existing schemes can only detect a portion of them. In this paper, we present MVVDroid, an Android malware detection technique based on software visualization and multi-view learning. To capture the semantic information of Android apps comprehensively, we first visualize the apps from three views, including behavior view, operation view and bytecode view. Software visualization helps us to extract the apps’ multi-granularity structural information, which is distinctive for malware detection. We then fuse the comprehensive semantics at different levels to profile the maliciousness of the apps precisely based on multi-view learning. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first work that combines multi-view learning with software visualization to achieve an effective Android malware detection. Experiments show that MVVDroid is more effective than other representative techniques, such as Drebin and a visualization-based method proposed by Sun et al. in 2021, with an accuracy of 97.78% and an F1-score of 97.14%. Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness of different combinations of views to validate the rationality of our view selection.

260. Malware Resistant Data Protection in Hyper-connected Networks: A survey
Abstract:
Data protection is the process of securing sensitive information from being corrupted, compromised, or lost. A hyperconnected network, on the other hand, is a computer networking trend in which communication occurs over a network. However, what about malware. Malware is malicious software meant to penetrate private data, threaten a computer system, or gain unauthorised network access without the users consent. Due to the increasing applications of computers and dependency on electronically saved private data, malware attacks on sensitive information have become a dangerous issue for individuals and organizations across the world. Hence, malware defense is critical for keeping our computer systems and data protected. Many recent survey articles have focused on either malware detection systems or single attacking strategies variously. To the best of our knowledge, no survey paper demonstrates malware attack patterns and defense strategies combinedly. Through this survey, this paper aims to address this issue by merging diverse malicious attack patterns and machine learning (ML) based detection models for modern and sophisticated malware. In doing so, we focus on the taxonomy of malware attack patterns based on four fundamental dimensions the primary goal of the attack, method of attack, targeted exposure and execution process, and types of malware that perform each attack. Detailed information on malware analysis approaches is also investigated. In addition, existing malware detection techniques employing feature extraction and ML algorithms are discussed extensively. Finally, it discusses research difficulties and unsolved problems, including future research directions.

264. Mitigating the Risks of Malware Attacks with Deep Learning Techniques
Abstract:
Malware has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, endangering people, businesses, and digital assets worldwide. Despite the numerous techniques and methodologies proposed for detecting and neutralizing malicious agents, modern automated malware creation methods continue to produce malware that can evade modern detection techniques. This has increased the need for advanced and accurate malware classification and detection techniques. This paper offers a unique method for classifying malware, using images that use dual attention and convolutional neural networks. Our proposed model has demonstrated exceptional performance in malware classification, achieving the remarkable accuracy of 98.14% on the Malimg benchmark dataset. To further validate its effectiveness, we also evaluated the model’s performance on the big 2015 dataset, where it achieved an even higher accuracy rate of 98.95%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art solutions. Several metrics, including the precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score were used to evaluate accuracy, showing how well our model performed. Additionally, we used class-balancing strategies to increase the accuracy of our model. The results obtained from our experiments indicate that our suggested model is of great interest, and can be applied as a trustworthy method for image-based malware detection, even when compared to more complex solutions. Overall, our research highlights the potential of deep learning frameworks to enhance cyber security measures, and mitigate the risks associated with malware attacks.

273. Deep Learning for Zero-day Malware Detection and Classification: A Survey
Abstract:
Zero-day malware is malware that has never been seen before or is so new that no anti-malware software can catch it. This novelty and the lack of existing mitigation strategies make zero-day malware challenging to detect and defend against. In recent years, deep learning has become the dominant and leading branch of machine learning in various research fields, including malware detection. Considering the significant threat of zero-day malware to cybersecurity and business continuity, it is necessary to identify deep learning techniques that can somehow be effective in detecting or classifying such malware. But so far, such a comprehensive review has not been conducted. In this article, we study deep learning techniques in terms of their ability to detect or classify zero-day malware. Based on our findings, we propose a taxonomy and divide different zero-day resistant, deep malware detection and classification techniques into four main categories: unsupervised, semi-supervised, few-shot, and adversarial resistant. We compare the techniques in each category in terms of various factors, including deep learning architecture, feature encoding, platform, detection or classification functionality, and whether the authors have performed a zero-day evaluation. We also provide a summary view of the reviewed papers and discuss their main characteristics and challenges.

280. Plain Source Code Obfuscation as an Effective Attack Method on IoT Malware Image Classification
Abstract:
IoT malware is rapidly increasing due to variants easily generated from publicly available source codes. Malware image classification capable of fast and accurate malware identification attracts attention. Since the classification by imaging is affected by malware binary changes, a binary modification without behavioral changes can be a potential attacking method to the classification by imaging. There are concerns that by combining the publicly available malware source code with readily available source code obfuscation tools, it is possible to construct an effective attack that bypasses image classifiers relatively simply. In this study, we show the effectiveness of the attack by source code obfuscation and the possibility of defense against the attack. The contribution of this research is twofold. 1) We showed that Obfuscator-LLVM (oLLVM) code obfuscation could be used as an attack method on malware image classification. The obfuscated malware binaries made by oLLVM were misclassified by VGG16-based image classifier for all the attacked malware families including Mirai, Lightaidra, and Bashlite. 2) We showed that classifier training with obfuscated samples could address this attack method. We confirmed that the malware image classifier trained with obfuscated malware binaries made by oLLVM could classify with an accuracy of 100% the malware family with obfuscation as the obfuscated original malware family.

290. Image Representation and Deep Inception-Attention for File-type and Malware Classification
Abstract:
File-type classification aims to recognize the file types of files/fragments without file-system metadata, which is essential for memory forensics and data recovery. In this paper, we introduce an image representation and deep inception-attention manner for file-type classification. Specifically, we consider file-type classification as an image classification problem. Raw data sequences in the memory block are converted to 2D binary images, enriching the representation ability and visualization while retaining the completeness of the bitstream. With binary images as inputs, we propose a deep inception-attention network to extract discriminate horizontal features and re-calibrate the weights of feature maps, and finally, predict file types. Experiments on a large-scale benchmark show the superiority of the proposed model. Moreover, our method can be extended to a similar application, like malware classification, and achieve outstanding performance.

297. MDENet: Multi-modal Dual-embedding Networks for Malware Open-set Recognition
Abstract:
Malware open-set recognition (MOSR) aims at jointly classifying malware samples from known families and detect the ones from novel unknown families, respectively. Existing works mostly rely on a well-trained classifier considering the predicted probabilities of each known family with a threshold-based detection to achieve the MOSR. However, our observation reveals that the feature distributions of malware samples are extremely similar to each other even between known and unknown families. Thus the obtained classifier may produce overly high probabilities of testing unknown samples toward known families and degrade the model performance. In this paper, we propose the Multi-modal Dual-Embedding Networks, dubbed MDENet, to take advantage of comprehensive malware features (i.e., malware images and malware sentences) from different modalities to enhance the diversity of malware feature space, which is more representative and discriminative for down-stream recognition. Last, to further guarantee the open-set recognition, we dually embed the fused multi-modal representation into one primary space and an associated sub-space, i.e., discriminative and exclusive spaces, with contrastive sampling and rho-bounded enclosing sphere regularizations, which resort to classification and detection, respectively. Moreover, we also enrich our previously proposed large-scaled malware dataset MAL-100 with multi-modal characteristics and contribute an improved version dubbed MAL-100+. Experimental results on the widely used malware dataset Mailing and the proposed MAL-100+ demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

300. From Grim Reality to Practical Solution: Malware Classification in Real-World Noise
Abstract:
Malware datasets inevitably contain incorrect labels due to the shortage of expertise and experience needed for sample labeling. Previous research demonstrated that a training dataset with incorrectly labeled samples would result in inaccurate model learning. To address this problem, researchers have proposed various noise learning methods to offset the impact of incorrectly labeled samples, and in image recognition and text mining applications, these methods demonstrated great success. In this work, we apply both representative and state-of-the-art noise learning methods to real-world malware classification tasks. We surprisingly observe that none of the existing methods could minimize incorrect labels’ impact. Through a carefully designed experiment, we discover that the inefficacy mainly results from extreme data imbalance and the high percentage of incorrectly labeled data samples. As such, we further propose a new noise learning method and name it after MORSE. Unlike existing methods, MORSE customizes and extends a state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning technique. It takes possibly incorrectly labeled data as unlabeled data and thus avoids their potential negative impact on model learning. In MORSE, we also integrate a sample re-weighting method that balances the training data usage in the model learning and thus handles the data imbalance challenge. We evaluate MORSE on both our synthesized and real-world datasets. We show that MORSE could significantly outperform existing noise learning methods and minimize the impact of incorrectly labeled data.

303. Malicious code detection based on many‐objective transfer model
Abstract:
With the rapid growth of malicious codes, personal privacy, and Internet security are seriously threatened. Existing transfer learning‐based malicious code detection improves detection accuracy by transferring pre‐trained neural networks. However, it cannot efficiently tune the structure and parameters of the neural networks. Here, we first propose a novel many‐objective transfer model. It mainly focuses on the detection accuracy and the total number of parameters of the neural network model. The optimal structure and parameters are captured from the pre‐trained neural network by many‐objective optimization algorithm. Second, the partitioned crossover‐mutation vector angle‐based evolutionary algorithm for unconstrained many‐objective optimization is proposed to solve the model. The algorithm performs crossover mutation operations in different ways on different regions of the candidate solution to improve population diversity. The simulation results show that the model can reduce the pre‐trained neural network structure by 49% while maintaining the accuracy in malicious code detection.

In recent years, malware has experienced explosive growth and has become one of the most severe security threats. However, feature engineering easily restricts the traditional machine learning methods-based malware classification and is hard to deal with massive malware. At the same time, the dynamic analysis methods have the problems of complex operation and high cost, which are not suitable for efficiently classifying large quantities of malware. Therefore, we propose a novel static malware detection method based on this study’s AlexNet convolutional neural network (CNN). Unlike existing solutions, we convert all malware bytes into color images, propose an improved AlexNet architecture, and solve the unbalanced datasets with the data enhancement method. Extensive experiments are performed using the Microsoft malware dataset and the Google Code Jam (GCJ) dataset. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the Microsoft malware dataset reaches 99.99%, and the GCJ dataset reaches 99.38%. We also verify that our method can better extract the texture features of malware and improve the accuracy and detection efficiency.

307. A systematic literature review of cyber-security data repositories and performance assessment metrics for semi-supervised learning
Abstract:
In Machine Learning, the datasets used to build models are one of the main factors limiting what these models can achieve and how good their predictive performance is. Machine Learning applications for cyber-security or computer security are numerous including cyber threat mitigation and security infrastructure enhancement through pattern recognition, real-time attack detection, and in-depth penetration testing. Therefore, for these applications in particular, the datasets used to build the models must be carefully thought to be representative of real-world data. However, because of the scarcity of labelled data and the cost of manually labelling positive examples, there is a growing corpus of literature utilizing Semi-Supervised Learning with cyber-security data repositories. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of publicly available data repositories and datasets used for building computer security or cyber-security systems based on Semi-Supervised Learning, where only a few labels are necessary or available for building strong models. We highlight the strengths and limitations of the data repositories and sets and provide an analysis of the performance assessment metrics used to evaluate the built models. Finally, we discuss open challenges and provide future research directions for using cyber-security datasets and evaluating models built upon them.

312. An Efficient Boosting-Based Windows Malware Family Classification System Using Multi-Features Fusion
Abstract:
In previous years, cybercriminals have utilized various strategies to evade identification, including obfuscation, confusion, and polymorphism technology, resulting in an exponential increase in the amount of malware that poses a serious threat to computer security. The use of techniques such as code reuse, automation, etc., also makes it more arduous to identify variant software in malware families. To effectively detect the families to which malware belongs, this paper proposed and discussed a new malware fusion feature set and classification system based on the BIG2015 dataset. We used a forward feature stepwise selection technique to combine plausible binary and assembly malware features to produce new and efficient fused features. A number of machine-learning techniques, including extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), are used to confirm the effectiveness of the fusion feature set and malware classification system. The experimental findings demonstrate that the XGBoost algorithm’s classification accuracy on the fusion feature set suggested in this paper can reach 99.87%. In addition, we applied tree-boosting-based LightGBM and CatBoost algorithms to the domain of malware classification for the first time. On our fusion feature set, the corresponding classification accuracy can reach 99.84% and 99.76%, respectively, and the F1-scores can achieve 99.66% and 99.28%, respectively.

319. Deepfake detection technique based on improved transformer model
Abstract:
Deepfake open source technology has lowered the threshold for AI face swapping to a very low level, making it possible to swap faces with one click. The cost of "disinformation" is greatly reduced, so that some deeply faked pictures and videos can be spread on social networks The social network can spread explosively. However, in the defense layer, there are almost no standardized and automated detection tools for deepfake. There is no such tool. Therefore, whether for individuals or platforms, the time window for fighting fake and disinformation is very short, but it is very difficult. In this paper, we use the Transformer model as a base, improve the model and optimize the structure of the model, so that the model can extract the depth features of the video and build a more accurate and efficient deepfake inspection method.

327. Malware detection in IOMT (MDI) using RNN-LSTM
Abstract:
The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently emerged as a cutting-edge technology for creating smart environments. The Internet of Things (IoT) connects systems, applications, data storage, and services, which may be a new entry point for cyber-attacks as they provide continuous services in the organization. At the current time, software piracy and malware attacks pose significant threats to IoT security. These threats may grab vital information, causing economic and reputational harm. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a subset of the Internet of Things in which medical equipment exchanges highly confidential with one another. These advancements allow the healthcare industry to maintain a higher level of touch and care for its patients. Security is viewed as a significant challenge in any technology's reliance on the IoT. Remote hijacking, impersonation, denial of service attacks, password guessing, and man-in-the-middle are all security concerns. Critical data associated with IoT connectivity may be revealed, altered, or even rendered inaccessible to authenticated persons in the event of such attacks. the deep recurrent neural network is used to detect malicious infections in IoT networks by displaying color images. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting cyber-attacks on IoMT systems that tends to make use of innovative deep learning. Specifically, our method incorporates a set of long short-term memory (LSTM) modules into a detector ensemble using a recurrent neural network.

330. Malware Family Classification Based on Vision Transformer
Abstract:

 Cybersecurity worries intensify as Big Data, the Internet of Things, and 5G technologies develop. Based on code reuse technologies, malware creators are producing new malware quickly, and new malware is continually endangering the effectiveness of existing detection methods. We propose a vision transformer-based approach for malware picture identification because, in contrast to CNN, Transformer’s self-attentive process is not constrained by local interactions and can simultaneously compute long-range mine relationships. We use ViT-B/16 weights pre-trained on the ImageNet21k dataset to improve model generalization capability and fine-tune them for the malware image classification task. This work demonstrates that (i) a pure attention mechanism applies to malware recognition, and (ii) the Transformer can be used instead of traditional CNN for malware image recognition. We train and assess our models using the MalImg dataset and the BIG2015 dataset in this paper. Our experimental evaluation found that the recognition accuracy of transfer learning-based ViT for MalImg samples and BIG2015 samples is 99.14% and 98.22%, respectively. This study shows that training ViT models using transfer learning can perform better than CNN in malware family classification.

Abstract:
Abstract In image analysis and processing, image segmentation is one of the most important functions. The outcomes of segmentation have such significance on all subsequent image analysis operations, covering object tracking and description, feature measurement, and even higher-level tasks like object recognition. Malicious code detection is becoming increasingly significant, and current models must be improved. Hence forth the Image segmentation in the field of Malware image classification is a significant task. The sectional structure or region of interest must be identified and extracted during the segmentation process so that it can be evaluated independently. There are various reviews stating the traditional approach of image segmentation in various fields. The necessity of image segmentation in malicious image is extracting data for classification using CNN is discussed. In this work we use malimg_paper_dataset_imgs with 9,339 malware images. Various segmentation techniques were used to enhance the malware images. Those enhanced malicious image were applied in CNN architecture and Mal_CNN for classification and a comparative result is been discussed. The malicious images in dataset after incorporating segmentation have achieved 95% of accuracy in CNN architecture and 97% with Mal_CNN.

341. A Visualized Malware Detection Framework with CNN and Conditional GAN
Abstract:
Malware visualization analysis incorporating with Machine Learning (ML) has been proven to be a promising solution for improving security defenses on different platforms. In this work, we propose an integrated framework for addressing common problems experienced by ML utilizers in developing malware detection systems. Namely, a pictorial presentation system with extensions is designed to preserve the identities of benign/malign samples by encoding each variable into binary digits and mapping them into black and white pixels. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network based model is adopted to produce synthetic images and mitigate issues of imbalance classes. Detection models architected by Convolutional Neural Networks are for validating performances while training on datasets with and without artifactual samples. Result demonstrates accuracy rates of 98.51% and 97.26% for these two training scenarios.

344. An Efficient Malware Classification Method Based on the AIFS-IDL and Multi-Feature Fusion
Abstract:
In recent years, the presence of malware has been growing exponentially, resulting in enormous demand for efficient malware classification methods. However, the existing machine learning-based classifiers have high false positive rates and cannot effectively classify malware variants, packers, and obfuscation. To address this shortcoming, this paper proposes an efficient deep learning-based method named AIFS-IDL (Atanassov Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets-Integrated Deep Learning), which uses static features to classify malware. The proposed method first extracts six types of features from the disassembly and byte files and then fuses them to solve the single-feature problem in traditional classification methods. Next, Atanassov’s intuitionistic fuzzy set-based method is used to integrate the result of the three deep learning models, namely, GRU (Temporal Convolutional Network), TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network), and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), which improves the classification accuracy and generalizability of the classification model. The proposed method is verified by experiments and the results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of malware classification compared to the existing methods. Experiments were carried out on the six types of features of malicious code and compared with traditional classification algorithms and ensemble learning algorithms. A variety of comparative experiments show that the classification accuracy rate of integrating multi-feature, multi-model aspects can reach 99.92%. The results show that, compared with other static classification methods, this method has better malware identification and classification ability.

350. From Data and Model Levels: Improve the Performance of Few-Shot Malware Classification
Abstract:
Existing malware classification methods cannot handle the open-ended growth of new or unknown malware well because it only focuses on pre-defined malware classes with sufficient training data. Due to the superiority of the visualization method, some researchers use it for solving few-shot malware classification. However, the malware images generated by existing visualization methods contain insufficient semantic information. At the same time, existing few-shot models tend to converge to sharp minima resulting in poor generalization performance. By synthesizing the observations, we think that accurate and effective few-shot malware classification methods are affected by generated malware images and classification models, which can be called data and model levels, respectively. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel method from the Data and Model levels, which is used to classify new or unknown malware well, called DMMal. More specifically, we propose a multi-channel malware image generation method based on multi-view so that malware images can contain more prosperous information at the data level. In addition, we investigated adaptive sharpness-aware minimization in a few-shot scenario from the perspective of model optimization at the model level to minimize the loss value and sharpness simultaneously. This enhances the generalization ability of the model and improves the ability of the model to classify new or unknown classes. Experiments on two few-shot malware classification datasets show that the method proposed can improve the performance of few-shot malware classification from the data and model levels.

353. Measurement of Malware Family Classification on a Large-Scale Real-World Dataset
Abstract:
There are many review articles on malware analysis, which provide a comprehensive summary of the features, methods, and challenges of malware analysis. But these are limited to a theoretical overview. The purpose of this paper is to take malware family classification as an example, to restore and display the malware analysis in real scenarios.In this paper, the measurement of malware family classification is carried out on a large-scale dataset in the real world. We use the BODMAS dataset, which contains a total of 57,293 malware samples, with carefully curated family information (581 families). Referring to the common features (including static features and dynamic features) and machine learning methods mentioned in the review articles, we conduct feature extraction and classification experiments. Then, we summarize the classification results. Static features can efficiently classify a large number of samples, even with 10% packed samples. In real scenarios, the family distribution is extremely unbalanced, and the family classification results with a large number of samples are better. Different evaluation methods have different interpretations of the classification results. These measurement results provide a basis for further malware analysis in real applications.

354. A Ransomware Classification Method Based on Entropy Map
Abstract:
With the rapid development and popularization of internet technologies such as AI and 5G, more and more organizations and individuals have suffered a dramatic increase in the number of ransomware attacks, which has brought substantial economic losses to them. Ransomware is an illegal act that blackmails victims into paying a ransom by locking their devices or encrypting files. Achieving fast and effective ransomware classification, attack intent and pattern analysis can improve the efficiency of security analysts and discover ransomware variants earlier. Therefore, we propose a new ransomware classification method, which uses the entropy map extracted from the ransomware binary file for classification. The entropy map retains more fine-grained features in the ransomware family, which can improve the classification result. Aiming at the problem of data imbalance among ransomware families, we propose a data augmentation method based on the Cycle-GAN network, which combines the fine-tuning technology in transfer learning to improve the classification result of the framework further. At the same time, the attention mechanism is introduced into VGG-16. It is used to enhance the ability of feature extraction of the network. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the best performance on 14 ransomware families, and the accuracy rate can reach 97.16%, which is better than other traditional ransomware visualization classification methods. Our proposed method still has the best classification performance compared with other neural networks.

355. A Context-Aware Android Malware Detection Approach Using Machine Learning
Abstract:
The Android platform has become the most popular smartphone operating system, which makes it a target for malicious mobile apps. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for Android malware detection based on application features. Unlike many prior research that focused exclusively on API Calls and permissions features to improve detection efficiency and accuracy, this paper incorporates applications’ contextual features with API Calls and permissions features. Moreover, the proposed approach extracted a new dataset of static API Calls and permission features using a large dataset of malicious and benign Android APK samples. Furthermore, the proposed approach used the Information Gain algorithm to reduce the API and permission feature space from 527 to the most relevant 50 features only. Several combinations of API Calls, permissions, and contextual features were used. These combinations were fed into different machine-learning algorithms to show the significance of using the selected contextual features in detecting Android malware. The experiments show that the proposed model achieved a very high accuracy of about 99.4% when using contextual features in comparison to 97.2% without using contextual features. Moreover, the paper shows that the proposed approach outperformed the state-of-the-art models considered in this work.

375. Memory Visualization-Based Malware Detection Technique
Abstract:
Advanced Persistent Threat is an attack campaign in which an intruder or team of intruders establishes a long-term presence on a network to mine sensitive data, which becomes more dangerous when combined with polymorphic malware. This type of malware is not only undetectable, but it also generates multiple variants of the same type of malware in the network and remains in the system’s main memory to avoid detection. Few researchers employ a visualization approach based on a computer’s memory to detect and classify various classes of malware. However, a preprocessing step of denoising the malware images was not considered, which results in an overfitting problem and prevents us from perfectly generalizing a model. In this paper, we introduce a new data engineering approach comprising two main stages: Denoising and Re-Dimensioning. The first aims at reducing or ideally removing the noise in the malware’s memory-based dump files’ transformed images. The latter further processes the cleaned image by compressing them to reduce their dimensionality. This is to avoid the overfitting issue and lower the variance, computing cost, and memory utilization. We then built our machine learning model that implements the new data engineering approach and the result shows that the performance metrics of 97.82% for accuracy, 97.66% for precision, 97.25% for recall, and 97.57% for f1-score are obtained. Our new data engineering approach and machine learning model outperform existing solutions by 0.83% accuracy, 0.30% precision, 1.67% recall, and 1.25% f1-score. In addition to that, the computational time and memory usage have also reduced significantly.

376. Malware Classification and Visualization Using EfficientNet and B2IMG Algorithm
Abstract:
The growth of malware has been significantly high in the last few years. Signature-based and heuristic methods have already been used in malware classification for a long time, but since the growth of polymorphic, both methods have become irrelevant. This problem makes machine learning and deep learning popular to overcome this problem. EfficientNet is one of the transfer learning models, a deep learning subfield. It said that this model could beat the state of the art of deep learning classification in ImageNet. In this paper, the researcher already implemented several EffiicientNet models into two type of Malware BIG 2015 that had been visualized into grayscale and RGB format. From the experiment, we found that EfficientNetB7 implemented into RGB dataset got 99.63% of accuracy, 98.36% of precision, 98.35% of recall, 98.34% of F1-Score, and 98.30% of AUC, with only takes 10 epochs in training process. It could outperformed other pretrained model within a few epochs.

386. Explainable Malware Detection System Using Transformers-Based Transfer Learning and Multi-Model Visual Representation
Abstract:
Android has become the leading mobile ecosystem because of its accessibility and adaptability. It has also become the primary target of widespread malicious apps. This situation needs the immediate implementation of an effective malware detection system. In this study, an explainable malware detection system was proposed using transfer learning and malware visual features. For effective malware detection, our technique leverages both textual and visual features. First, a pre-trained model called the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model was designed to extract the trained textual features. Second, the malware-to-image conversion algorithm was proposed to transform the network byte streams into a visual representation. In addition, the FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) extractor and BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features) descriptor were used to efficiently extract and mark important features. Third, the trained and texture features were combined and balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling (SMOTE) method; then, the CNN network was used to mine the deep features. The balanced features were then input into the ensemble model for efficient malware classification and detection. The proposed method was analyzed extensively using two public datasets, CICMalDroid 2020 and CIC-InvesAndMal2019. To explain and validate the proposed methodology, an interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) experiment was conducted.

396. Self-Supervised Vision Transformers for Malware Detection
Abstract:
Malware detection plays a crucial role in cyber-security with the increase in malware growth and advancements in cyber-attacks. Previously unseen malware which is not determined by security vendors are often used in these attacks and it is becoming inevitable to find a solution that can self-learn from unlabeled sample data. This paper presents SHERLOCK, a self-supervision based deep learning model to detect malware based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. SHERLOCK is a novel malware detection method which learns unique features to differentiate malware from benign programs with the use of image-based binary representation. Experimental results using 1.2 million Android applications across a hierarchy of 47 types and 696 families, shows that self-supervised learning can achieve an accuracy of 97% for the binary classification of malware which is higher than existing state-of-the-art techniques. Our proposed model is also able to outperform state-of-the-art techniques for multi-class malware classification of types and family with macro-F1 score of.497 and.491 respectively.

397. On deceiving malware classification with section injection
Abstract:
We investigate how to modify executable files to deceive malware classification systems. This work’s main contribution is a methodology to inject bytes across a malware file randomly and use it both as an attack to decrease classification accuracy but also as a defensive method, augmenting the data available for training. It respects the operating system file format to make sure the malware will still execute after our injection and will not change its behavior. We reproduced five state-of-the-art malware classification approaches to evaluate our injection scheme: one based on Global Image Descriptor (GIST) + K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN), three Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) variations and one Gated CNN. We performed our experiments on a public dataset with 9339 malware samples from 25 different families. Our results show that a mere increase of 7% in the malware size causes an accuracy drop between 25% and 40% for malware family classification. They show that an automatic malware classification system may not be as trustworthy as initially reported in the literature. We also evaluate using modified malware alongside the original ones to increase networks robustness against the mentioned attacks. The results show that a combination of reordering malware sections and injecting random data can improve the overall performance of the classification. All the code is publicly available.

404. A Novel Deep Learning Based Attention Mechanism for Android Malware Detection and Explanation
Abstract:
With the popularity of Android mobile devices and the increase of related applications, hackers regard it as the primary attack target. Therefore, malware detection is essential nowadays, and many of these studies employ deep learning techniques. In recent years, the attention mechanism provides corresponding attention weights for different hidden states, and it is widely used in many fields, such as machine translation and image markup. However, no research has applied the attention mechanism to Android malware analysis. Hence, this paper completes the goal of malware family classification based on the static features of Android applications. We compare the difference between the original convolutional neural network (CNN) and the addition of the attention mechanism. The final experimental results show that the attention mechanism improves the accuracy of the existing CNN model by 1.99% in static opcode images. In addition, we further adopt the occlusion sensitivity method to try to explain the classification model proposed in this paper. Finally, the experimental results of model interpretation show that the classification model can effectively identify the threat behavior of malware.

408. Toward Improving the Security of IoT and CPS Devices: An AI Approach
Abstract:
Detecting anomalously behaving devices in security-and-safety-critical applications is an important challenge. This article presents an off-device methodology for detecting the anomalous behavior of devices considering their power consumption data. The methodology takes advantage of the fact that every action on-board a device will be reflected in its power trace. This argument makes it inevitable for anomalously behaving device to go undetected. We transform the device’s one-dimensional (1D) instantaneous power consumption signals to 2D time–frequency images using Constant Q Transformation (CQT). The CQT images capture valuable information about the tasks performed on-board a device. By applying Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) on the CQT images, we extract robust features that preserve the edges of time–frequency structures and capture the directionality of the edge information. Consequently, we transform the anomaly detection problem into an image classification problem. We train a Convolutional Neural Network on the HOG images to classify the power signals to detect anomaly. We validated the methodology using a wide spectrum of emulated malware scenarios, five real malware applications from the well-known Drebin dataset, Distributed Denial of Service attacks, cryptomining malware, and faulty CPU cores. Across 18 datasets, our methodology demonstrated detection performance of ∼88% accuracy and 85% F-Score, resulting in improvements of 9–17% over other methods using power signals.

However, in recent years, researchers have discovered that the deep learning model itself also has security risks. While malware detection based on deep learning brings convenience and technical progress, it also introduces some new threats, such as adversarial examples. This paper investigates adversarial example attacks against deep learning-based malware detectors. First, We reviewed research on malware detection techniques. Then we analyze the works related to adversarial example attacks against intelligent malware detectors. Finally, we discuss the challenges and prospects in future research.

424. Deep Learning and Blockchain-based Framework to Detect Malware in Autonomous Vehicles
Abstract:
The advancement in technology has brought to life the concept of Autonomous vehicles (AV). The primary goal of AV is to reduce driving stress and provide comfort to the occupants. Since AVs can drive themselves, it poses a question of passenger security. Furthermore, AVs are connected to an open network like a public Internet to communicate to the outer world, raising security and privacy concerns. Skillful attackers can effortlessly infiltrate the vehicle by injecting malware which can disrupt the regular operation of the entire AV system. A Deep Learning (DL) and Blockchain framework is proposed for AV to resolve the aforementioned security challenges. The network traffic is continuously monitored, and the malware binaries are converted to grey-scale images, which are then classified by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) employed in the DL model. The CNN architecture, ResNet50V2, has been tested and proves to be efficient in detecting malware with an accuracy of 97.56%.

Abstract:
The volume of malware and the number of attacks in IoT devices are rising everyday, which encourages security professionals to continually enhance their malware analysis tools. Researchers in the field of cyber security have extensively explored the usage of sophisticated analytics and the efficiency of malware detection. With the introduction of new malware kinds and attack routes, security experts confront considerable challenges in developing efficient malware detection and analysis solutions. In this paper, a different view of malware analysis is considered and the risk level of each sample feature is computed, and based on that the risk level of that sample is calculated. In this way, a criterion is introduced that is used together with accuracy and FPR criteria for malware analysis in IoT environment. In this paper, three malware detection methods based on visualization techniques called the clustering approach, the probabilistic approach, and the deep learning approach are proposed. Then, in addition to the usual machine learning criteria namely accuracy and FPR, a proposed criterion based on the risk of samples has also been used for comparison, with the results showing that the deep learning approach performed better in detecting malware

440. Cryptocurrency Mining Malware Detection Based on Behavior Pattern and Graph Neural Network
Abstract:
Miner malware has been steadily increasing in recent years as the value of cryptocurrency rises, which poses a considerable threat to users’ device security. Miner malware has obvious behavior patterns in order to participate in blockchain computing. However, most miner malware detection methods use raw bytes feature and sequential opcode as detection features. It is difficult for these methods to obtain better detection results due to not modeling robust features. In this paper, a miner malware identification method based on graph classification network is designed by analyzing the features of function call graph and control flow graph of miner malware, called MBGINet. MBGINet can model the behavior graph relationship of miner malware by extracting the connection features of critical nodes in the behavior graph. Finally, MBGINet transforms these node features into the feature vectors of the graph for miner malware identification. In the test experiments, datasets with different volumes are used for simulating real-world scenarios. The experimental results show that the MBGINet method achieves a leading and stable performance compared to the dedicated opcode detection method and obtains an accuracy improvement of 3.08% on the simulated in-the-wild dataset. Meanwhile, MBGINet gains an advantage over the general malware detection method Malconv. These experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the MBGINet method, which has excellent characteristics in adapting to realistic scenarios.

443. MERLIN - Malware Evasion with Reinforcement LearnINg
Abstract:
In addition to signature-based and heuristics-based detection techniques, machine learning (ML) is widely used to generalize to new, never-before-seen malicious software (malware). However, it has been demonstrated that ML models can be fooled by tricking the classifier into returning the incorrect label. These studies, for instance, usually rely on a prediction score that is fragile to gradient-based attacks. In the context of a more realistic situation where an attacker has very little information about the outputs of a malware detection engine, modest evasion rates are achieved. In this paper, we propose a method using reinforcement learning with DQN and REINFORCE algorithms to challenge two state-of-the-art ML-based detection engines (MalConv \&EMBER) and a commercial AV classified by Gartner as a leader AV. Our method combines several actions, modifying a Windows portable execution (PE) file without breaking its functionalities. Our method also identifies which actions perform better and compiles a detailed vulnerability report to help mitigate the evasion. We demonstrate that REINFORCE achieves very good evasion rates even on a commercial AV with limited available information.

451. Efficient Malware Classification by Binary Sequences with One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks
Abstract:
The rapid increase of malware attacks has become one of the main threats to computer security. Finding the best way to detect malware has become a critical task in cybersecurity. Previous work shows that machine learning approaches could be a solution to address this problem. Many proposed methods convert malware executables into grayscale images and apply convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for malware classification. However, converting malware executables into images could twist the one-dimensional structure of binary codes. To address this problem, we explore the bit and byte-level sequences from malware executables and propose efficient one-dimensional (1D) CNNs for the malware classification. Our experiments evaluate our proposed 1D CNN models with two benchmark datasets. Our proposed 1D CNN models achieve better performance from the experimental results than the existing 2D CNNs malware classification models by providing smaller resizing bit/byte-level sequences with less computational cost.

453. IoT malware detection architecture using a novel channel boosted and squeezed CNN
Abstract:
Interaction between devices, people, and the Internet has given birth to a new digital communication model, the internet of things (IoT). The integration of smart devices to constitute a network introduces many security challenges. These connected devices have created a security blind spot, where cybercriminals can easily launch attacks to compromise the devices using malware proliferation techniques. Therefore, malware detection is a lifeline for securing IoT devices against cyberattacks. This study addresses the challenge of malware detection in IoT devices by proposing a new CNN-based IoT malware detection architecture (iMDA). The proposed iMDA is modular in design that incorporates multiple feature learning schemes in blocks including (1) edge exploration and smoothing, (2) multi-path dilated convolutional operations, and (3) channel squeezing and boosting in CNN to learn a diverse set of features. The local structural variations within malware classes are learned by Edge and smoothing operations implemented in the split-transform-merge (STM) block. The multi-path dilated convolutional operation is used to recognize the global structure of malware patterns. At the same time, channel squeezing and merging helped to regulate complexity and get diverse feature maps. The performance of the proposed iMDA is evaluated on a benchmark IoT dataset and compared with several state-of-the CNN architectures. The proposed iMDA shows promising malware detection capacity by achieving accuracy: 97.93%, F1-Score: 0.9394, precision: 0.9864, MCC: 0. 8796, recall: 0.8873, AUC-PR: 0.9689 and AUC-ROC: 0.9938. The strong discrimination capacity suggests that iMDA may be extended for the android-based malware detection and IoT Elf files compositely in the future.

454. A Novel Android Botnet Detection System Using Image-Based and Manifest File Features
Abstract:
Malicious botnet applications have become a serious threat and are increasingly incorporating sophisticated detection avoidance techniques. Hence, there is a need for more effective mitigation approaches to combat the rise of Android botnets. Although the use of Machine Learning to detect botnets has been a focus of recent research efforts, several challenges remain. To overcome the limitations of using hand-crafted features for Machine-Learning-based detection, in this paper, we propose a novel mobile botnet detection system based on features extracted from images and a manifest file. The scheme employs a Histogram of Oriented Gradients and byte histograms obtained from images representing the app executable and combines these with features derived from the manifest files. Feature selection is then applied to utilize the best features for classification with Machine-Learning algorithms. The proposed system was evaluated using the ISCX botnet dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness with F1 scores ranging from 0.923 to 0.96 using popular Machine-Learning algorithms. Furthermore, with the Extra Trees model, up to 97.5% overall accuracy was obtained using an 80:20 train–test split, and 96% overall accuracy was obtained using 10-fold cross validation.

460. An Android Malicious Application Detection Method with Decision Mechanism in the Operating Environment of Blockchain
Abstract:
Recently, security policies and behaviour detection methods have been proposed to improve the security of blockchain by many researchers. However, these methods cannot discover the source of typical behaviours, such as the malicious applications in the blockchain environment. Android application is an important part of the blockchain operating environment, and machine learning-based Android malware application detection method is significant for blockchain user security. The way of constructing features in these methods determines the performance. The single-feature mechanism, training classifiers with one type of features, cannot detect the malicious applications effectively which exhibit the typical behaviours in various forms. The multifeatures fusion mechanism, constructing mixed features from multiple types of data sources, can cover more kinds of information. However, different types of data sources will interfere with each other in the mixed features constructed by this mechanism. That limits the performance of the model. In order to improve the detection performance of Android malicious applications in complex scenarios, we propose an Android malicious application detection method which includes parallel feature processing and decision mechanism. Our method uses RGB image visualization technology to construct three types of RGB image which are utilized to train different classifiers, respectively, and a decision mechanism is designed to fuse the outputs of subclassifiers through weight analysis. This approach simultaneously extracts different types of features, which preserve application information comprehensively. Different classifiers are trained by these features to guarantee independence of each feature and classifier. On this basis, a comprehensive analysis of many methods is performed on the Android malware dataset, and the results show that our method has better efficiency and adaptability than others.

468. Android Malware Identification and Polymorphic Evolution Via Graph Representation Learning
Abstract:
Developing techniques to identify malware is critical. The polymorphic nature of malware makes it difficult to detect, especially if the detection is done with Hash-based based techniques. Image-based binary representations have been shown to be more robust to popular polymorphic obfuscation techniques. In contrast to image-based techniques, in this paper, we employed a graph-based technique that extracts control flow graphs from Android APK binary. To process the resulting graph, we use a procedure combining a new graph representation learning method, called Inferential SIR-GN for Graph representation, that preserves graph structural similarities, with XGboost, which is a standard machine learning model. Then, we apply this procedure to MALNET, which is a publicly available cybersecurity database that provides image and graph-based Android APK binary representations for a total 1,262,024 million Android APK binary with 47 types and 696 families. Experimental results show that this graph-based procedure is even more accurate than the image-based approach. Moreover, this paper provides a procedure that, by leveraging Inferential SIR-GN is able to create malware polymorphic evolution representations to use during the train of the XGboost that strengthens the malware classification tasks when the train and test datasets are split temporally according to the binary creation date. This means that our procedure can predict malware polymorphic evolution.

472. Malware Classification Using Static Disassembly and Machine Learning
Abstract:
Network and system security are incredibly critical issues now. Due to the rapid proliferation of malware, traditional analysis methods struggle with enormous samples.In this paper, we propose four easy-to-extract and small-scale features, including sizes and permissions of Windows PE sections, content complexity, and import libraries, to classify malware families, and use automatic machine learning to search for the best model and hyper-parameters for each feature and their combinations. Compared with detailed behavior-related features like API sequences, proposed features provide macroscopic information about malware. The analysis is based on static disassembly scripts and hexadecimal machine code. Unlike dynamic behavior analysis, static analysis is resource-efficient and offers complete code coverage, but is vulnerable to code obfuscation and encryption.The results demonstrate that features which work well in dynamic analysis are not necessarily effective when applied to static analysis. For instance, API 4-grams only achieve 57.96% accuracy and involve a relatively high dimensional feature set (5000 dimensions). In contrast, the novel proposed features together with a classical machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) presents very good accuracy at 99.40% and the feature vector is of much smaller dimension (40 dimensions). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through integration in IDA Pro, which also facilitates the collection of new training samples and subsequent model retraining.

474. Resilience against Adversarial Examples: Data-Augmentation Exploiting Generative Adversarial Networks
Abstract:
Recently, malware classification based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) has gained significant attention due to the rise in popularity of artificial intelligence (AI). DNN-based malware classifiers are a novel solution to combat never-before-seen malware families because this approach is able to classify malwares based on structural characteristics rather than requiring particular signatures like traditional malware classifiers. However, these DNN-based classifiers have been found to lack robustness against malwares that are carefully crafted to evade detection. These specially crafted pieces of malware are referred to as adversarial examples . We consider a clever adversary who has a thorough knowledge of DNN-based malware classifiers and will exploit it to generate a crafty malware to fool DNN-based classifiers. In this paper, we propose a DNN-based malware classifier that becomes resilient to these kinds of attacks by exploiting Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based data augmentation. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme classifies malware, including AEs, with a false positive rate (FPR) of 3.0% and a balanced accuracy of 70.16%. These are respective 26.1% and 18.5% enhancements when compared to a traditional DNN-based classifier that does not exploit GAN.

476. Image-based Ransomware Classification with Classifier Combination
Abstract:
Ransomware is becoming more and more rampant around the world nowadays. Traditional ransomware classification methods have difficulties when ransomware applies techniques to evade analysis. In this article, we proposed a method based on image visualization and classifier combination. Ransomware samples were converted to grayscale images, and images were extracted features by using three different techniques, including not only traditional two texture analysis methods: GIST descriptor and LBP algorithm, but also deep transfer learning method ResNet residual neural network. Different features can full-characterize the image in different aspects. Machine Learning was used for classifying the ransomware samples. We apply three classifiers(RF, MLP, and XGBoost) to the extracted features and get classification results. Furthermore, we combine the different classification results by using soft voting, finally, results show the model achieves high scores(F1-score=0.979, 0.991, and 0.967) and performance stabler.

478. Malfustection: Obfuscated Malware Detection and Malware Classification with Data Shortage by Combining Semi-Supervised and Contrastive Learning
Abstract:
With the advent of new technologies, using various formats of digital gadgets is becoming widespread. In today's world, where everyday tasks are inevitable without technology, this extensive use of computers paves the way for malicious activity. As a result, it is important to provide solutions to defend against these threats. Malware is one of the well-known and widely used means utilized for doing destructive activities by malicious attackers. Producing malware from scratch is somewhat difficult, so attackers tend to obfuscate existing malware and prepare it to become an unrecognizable program. Since creating new malware from an old one using obfuscation is a creative task, there are some drawbacks to identifying obfuscated malwares. In this research, we propose a solution to overcome this problem by converting the code to an image in the first step and then using a semi-supervised approach combined with contrastive learning. In this case, an obfuscation in the malware bytecode corresponds to an augmentation in the image. Hence, by utilizing meaningful augmentations, which simulate some obfuscation changes and combine them to generate complex ambiguity procedures, our proposed solution is able to construct, learn, and detect a wide range of obfuscations. This work addresses two issues: 1) malware classification despite the data deficiency and 2) obfuscated malware detection by training on non-obfuscated malwares. According to the results, the proposed method overcomes the data shortage problem in malware classification, as its accuracy is 90.1% when just 10% of data is used for training the model. Moreover, training on basic malwares without obfuscation achieved 96.21 percent accuracy in detecting obfuscated malware.

484. Virus-MNIST: Machine Learning Baseline Calculations for Image Classification
Abstract:
The Virus-MNIST data set is a collection of thumbnail images that is similar in style to the ubiquitous MNIST hand-written digits. These, however, are cast by reshaping possible malware code into an image array. Naturally, it is poised to take on a role in benchmarking progress of virus classifier model training. Ten types are present: nine classified as malware and one benign. Cursory examination reveals unequal class populations and other key aspects that must be considered when selecting classification and pre-processing methods. Exploratory analyses show possible identifiable characteristics from aggregate metrics (e.g., the pixel median values), and ways to reduce the number of features by identifying strong correlations. A model comparison shows that Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Random Forest algorithms produced the highest accuracy scores, thus showing promise for deeper scrutiny.

487. RoboMal: Malware Detection for Robot Network Systems
Abstract:
Robot systems are increasingly integrating into numerous avenues of modern life. From cleaning houses to providing guidance and emotional support, robots now work directly with humans. Due to their far-reaching applications and progressively complex architecture, they are being targeted by adversarial attacks such as sensor-actuator attacks, data spoofing, malware, and network intrusion. Therefore, security for robotic systems has become crucial. In this paper, we address the underserved area of malware detection in robotic software. Since robots work in close proximity to humans, often with direct interactions, malware could have life-threatening impacts. Hence, we propose the RoboMal framework of static malware detection on binary executables to detect malware before it gets a chance to execute. Additionally, we address the great paucity of data in this space by providing the RoboMal dataset1 comprising controller executables of a small-scale autonomous car. The performance of the framework is compared against widely used supervised learning models: GRU, CNN, and ANN. Notably, the LSTM-based RoboMal model outperforms the other models with an accuracy of 85% and precision of 87% in 10-fold cross-validation, hence proving the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

500. Identifying Major Research Areas and Minor Research Themes of Android Malware Analysis and Detection Field Using LSA
Abstract:
Contemporary technologies have ensured the availability of high-quality research data shared over the Internet. This has resulted in a tremendous availability of research literature, which keeps evolving itself. Thus, identification of core research areas and trends in such ever-evolving literature is not only challenging but interesting too.

508. A Survey on Common Threats in npm and PyPi Registries
Abstract:
Software engineers regularly use JavaScript and Python for both front-end and back-end automation tasks. On top of JavaScript and Python, there are several frameworks to facilitate automation tasks further. Some of these frameworks are Node Manager Package (npm) and Python Package Index (PyPi), which are open source (OS) package libraries. The public registries npm and PyPi use to host packages allow any user with a verified email to publish code. The lack of a comprehensive scanning tool when publishing to the registry creates security concerns. Users can report malicious code on the registry; however, attackers can still cause damage until they remove their tool from the platform. Furthermore, several packages depend on each other, making them more vulnerable to a bad package in the dependency tree. The heavy code reuse creates security artifacts developers have to consider, such as the package reach. This project will illustrate a high-level overview of common risks associated with OS registries and the package dependency structure. There are several attack types, such as typosquatting and combosquatting, in the OS package registries. Outdated packages pose a security risk, and we will examine the extent of technical lag present in the npm environment. In this paper, our main contribution consists of a survey of common threats in OS registries. Afterward, we will offer countermeasures to mitigate the risks presented. These remedies will heavily focus on the applications of Machine Learning (ML) to detect suspicious activities. To the best of our knowledge, the ML-focused countermeasures are the first proposed possible solutions to the security problems listed. In addition, this project is the first survey of threats in npm and PyPi, although several studies focus on a subset of threats.

509. A comprehensive study on learning-based PE malware family classification methods
Abstract:
Driven by the high profit, Portable Executable (PE) malware has been consistently evolving in terms of both volume and sophistication. PE malware family classification has gained great attention and a large number of approaches have been proposed. With the rapid development of machine learning techniques and the exciting results they achieved on various tasks, machine learning algorithms have also gained popularity in the PE malware family classification task. Three mainstream approaches that use learning based algorithms, as categorized by the input format the methods take, are image-based, binary-based and disassembly-based approaches. Although a large number of approaches are published, there is no consistent comparisons on those approaches, especially from the practical industry adoption perspective. Moreover, there is no comparison in the scenario of concept drift, which is a fact for the malware classification task due to the fast evolving nature of malware. In this work, we conduct a thorough empirical study on learning-based PE malware classification approaches on 4 different datasets and consistent experiment settings. Based on the experiment results and an interview with our industry partners, we find that (1) there is no individual class of methods that significantly outperforms the others; (2) All classes of methods show performance degradation on concept drift (by an average F1-score of 32.23%); and (3) the prediction time and high memory consumption hinder existing approaches from being adopted for industry usage.

514. Malware Classification Using Transfer Learning
Abstract:
With the rapid growth of the number of devices on the Internet, malware poses a threat not only to the affected devices but also their ability to use said devices to launch attacks on the Internet ecosystem. Rapid malware classification is an important tools to combat that threat. One of the successful approaches to classification is based on malware images and deep learning. While many deep learning architectures are very accurate they usually take a long time to train. In this work we perform experiments on multiple well known, pre-trained, deep network architectures in the context of transfer learning. We show that almost all them classify malware accurately with a very short training period.

518. Detection of Malicious Software by Analyzing Distinct Artifacts Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms
Abstract:
Malware is one of the most significant threats in today’s computing world since the number of websites distributing malware is increasing at a rapid rate. Malware analysis and prevention methods are increasingly becoming necessary for computer systems connected to the Internet. This software exploits the system’s vulnerabilities to steal valuable information without the user’s knowledge, and stealthily send it to remote servers controlled by attackers. Traditionally, anti-malware products use signatures for detecting known malware. However, the signature-based method does not scale in detecting obfuscated and packed malware. Considering that the cause of a problem is often best understood by studying the structural aspects of a program like the mnemonics, instruction opcode, API Call, etc. In this paper, we investigate the relevance of the features of unpacked malicious and benign executables like mnemonics, instruction opcodes, and API to identify a feature that classifies the executable. Prominent features are extracted using Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance (mRMR) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Experiments were conducted on four datasets using machine learning and deep learning approaches such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes, J48, Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost. In addition, we also evaluate the performance of the collection of deep neural networks like Deep Dense network, One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), and CNN-LSTM in classifying unknown samples, and we observed promising results using APIs and system calls. On combining APIs/system calls with static features, a marginal performance improvement was attained comparing models trained only on dynamic features. Moreover, to improve accuracy, we implemented our solution using distinct deep learning methods and demonstrated a fine-tuned deep neural network that resulted in an F1-score of 99.1% and 98.48% on Dataset-2 and Dataset-3, respectively.

522. EfficientNet-based Convolutional Neural Networks for Malware Classification
Abstract:
Malicious software is posing a great challenge to Cybersecurity by causing huge damage to enterprises and users. Traditional signature-based techniques have found it challenging to detect malware as it has changed and evolved over time. Machine learning techniques have become popular for malware detection but they are based on heuristic feature engineering, which is expensive and requires domain expertise. In the recent years, deep learning, are being actively investigated for this crucial malware detection application to achieve robust solutions with higher accuracy. To assist in achieving this goal, the EfficientNet-B1 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset with the last layer adapted to attain malware family classification is presented. The malware samples to be inputted are represented as byteplot grayscale images. The experimental results on a dataset comprising of 10,868 samples from 9 different malware families showed that the proposed approach can be effectively used to classify malware families. Classification accuracy of 98.57% on the held-out test set was obtained by the proposed model which outperformed the other pretrained deep learning models.

523. Auxiliary-Classifier GAN for Malware Analysis
Abstract:
Generative adversarial networks (GAN) are a class of powerful machine learning techniques, where both a generative and discriminative model are trained simultaneously. GANs have been used, for example, to successfully generate"deep fake"images. A recent trend in malware research consists of treating executables as images and employing image-based analysis techniques. In this research, we generate fake malware images using auxiliary classifier GANs (AC-GAN), and we consider the effectiveness of various techniques for classifying the resulting images. Our results indicate that the resulting multiclass classification problem is challenging, yet we can obtain strong results when restricting the problem to distinguishing between real and fake samples. While the AC-GAN generated images often appear to be very similar to real malware images, we conclude that from a deep learning perspective, the AC-GAN generated samples do not rise to the level of deep fake malware images.

531. Detection and Classification of Malicious Software based on Regional Matching of Temporal Graphs
Abstract:
In this paper we present an integrated graph-based framework that utilizes relations between groups of System-calls, in order to detect whether an unknown software sample is malicious or benign, and to a further extent to classify it to a known malware family. A novel graph-based approach for the representation of software samples over the depiction of the structural evolution over time, the so-called Temporal Graphs, is discussed, and a method for measuring graph similarity among specific Regions of such graphs is proposed, the so-called Regional Matching. The partitioning of the Temporal Graphs that depicts their structural evolution over time is defined by specific time-slots, while the quantitative characteristics that depict the commonalities appeared over the weights of the vertices are measured by a similarity metric in order to conduct the malware detection and classification procedures. Finally, we evaluate the detection and classification ability of our proposed graph-based framework performing an experimental study over the achieved results utilizing a set of known malicious samples that are indexed into malware families.

537. A Multi-Dimensional Deep Learning Framework for IoT Malware Classification and Family Attribution
Abstract:
The emergence of Internet of Things malware, which leverages exploited IoT devices to perform large-scale cyber attacks (e.g., Mirai botnet), is considered as a major threat to the Internet ecosystem. To mitigate such threat, there is an utmost need for effective IoT malware classification and family attribution, which provide essential steps towards initiating attack mitigation/prevention countermeasures. In this paper, motivated by the lack of sophisticated malware obfuscation in the implementation of IoT malware, we utilize features extracted from strings- and image-based representations of the executable binaries to propose a novel multi-dimensional classification approach using Deep Learning (DL) architectures. To this end, we analyze more than 70,000 recently detected IoT malware samples. Our in-depth experiments with four prominent IoT malware families highlight the significant accuracy of the approach (99.78%), which outperforms conventional single-level classifiers. Additionally, we utilize our IoT-tailored approach for labeling newly detected “unknown” malware samples, which were mainly attributed to a few predominant families. Finally, this work contributes to the security of future networks (e.g., 5G) through the implementation of effective tools/techniques for timely IoT malware classification, and attack mitigation.

545. Malware homology determination using visualized images and feature fusion
Abstract:
The family homology determination of malware has become a research hotspot as the number of malware variants are on the rise. However, existing studies on malware visualization only determines homology based on the global structure features of executable, which leads creators of some malware variants with the same structure intentionally set to misclassify them as the same family. We sought to develop a homology determination method using the fusion of global structure features and local fine-grained features based on malware visualization. Specifically, the global structural information of the malware executable file was converted into a bytecode image, and the opcode semantic information of the code segment was extracted by the n-gram feature model to generate an opcode image. We also propose a dual-branch convolutional neural network, which features the opcode image and bytecode image as the final family classification basis. Our results demonstrate that the accuracy and F-measure of family homology classification based on the proposed scheme are 99.05% and 98.52% accurate, respectively, which is better than the results from a single image feature or other major schemes.

548. Data augmentation and transfer learning to classify malware images in a deep learning context
Abstract:
In the past few years, malware classification techniques have shifted from shallow traditional machine learning models to deeper neural network architectures. The main benefit of some of these is the ability to work with raw data, guaranteed by their automatic feature extraction capabilities. This results in less technical expertise needed while building the models, thus less initial pre-processing resources. Nevertheless, such advantage comes with its drawbacks, since deep learning models require huge quantities of data in order to generate a model that generalizes well. The amount of data required to train a deep network without overfitting is often unobtainable for malware analysts. We take inspiration from image-based data augmentation techniques and apply a sequence of semantics-preserving syntactic code transformations (obfuscations) to a small dataset of programs to generate a larger dataset. We then design two learning models, a convolutional neural network and a bi-directional long short-term memory, and we train them on images extracted from compiled binaries of the newly generated dataset. Through transfer learning we then take the features learned from the obfuscated binaries and train the models against two state of the art malware datasets, each containing around 10 000 samples. Our models easily achieve up to 98.5% accuracy on the test set, which is on par or better than the present state of the art approaches, thus validating the approach.

555. A Hierarchical Approach for Android Malware Detection Using Authorization-Sensitive Features
Abstract:
Android’s openness has made it a favorite for consumers and developers alike, driving strong app consumption growth. Meanwhile, its popularity also attracts attackers’ attention. Android malware is continually raising issues for the user’s privacy and security. Hence, it is of great practical value to develop a scientific and versatile system for Android malware detection. This paper presents a hierarchical approach to design a malware detection system for Android. It extracts four authorization-sensitive features: basic blocks, permissions, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and key functions, and layer-by-layer detects malware based on the similar module and the proposed deep learning model Convolutional Neural Network and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (CNNXGB). This detection approach focuses not only on classification but also on the details of the similarities between malware software. We serialize the key function in light of the sequence of API calls and pick up a similar module that captures the global semantics of malware. We propose a new method to convert the basic block into a multichannel picture and use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn features. We extract permissions and API calls based on their called frequency and train the classification model by XGBoost. A dynamic similar module feature library is created based on the extracted features to assess the sample’s behavior. The model is trained by utilizing 11,327 Android samples collected from Github, Google Play, Fdroid, and VirusShare. Promising experimental results demonstrate a higher accuracy of the proposed approach and its potential to detect Android malware attacks and reduce Android users’ security risks.

557. MalNet: A Large-Scale Image Database of Malicious Software
Abstract:
Computer vision is playing an increasingly important role in automated malware detection with the rise of the image-based binary representation. These binary images are fast to generate, require no feature engineering, and are resilient to popular obfuscation methods. Significant research has been conducted in this area, however, it has been restricted to small-scale or private datasets that only a few industry labs and research teams have access to. This lack of availability hinders examination of existing work, development of new research, and dissemination of ideas. We release MalNet-Image, the largest public cybersecurity image database, offering 24x more images and 70x more classes than existing databases (available at https://mal-net.org). MalNet-Image contains over 1.2 million malware images-across 47 types and 696 families---democratizing image-based malware capabilities by enabling researchers and practitioners to evaluate techniques that were previously reported in propriety settings. We report the first million-scale malware detection results on binary images. MalNet-Image unlocks new and unique opportunities to advance the frontiers of machine learning, enabling new research directions into vision-based cyber defenses, multi-class imbalanced classification, and interpretable security.

564. A Novel Malware Detection and Family Classification Scheme for IoT Based on DEAM and DenseNet
Abstract:
With the rapid increase in the amount and type of malware, traditional methods of malware detection and family classification for IoT applications through static and dynamic analysis have been greatly challenged. In this paper, a new simple and effective attention module of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), named as Depthwise Efficient Attention Module (DEAM), is proposed and combined with a DenseNet to propose a new malware detection and family classification model. Based on the good effect of the DenseNet in the field of image classification and the visual similarity of the malware family on images, the gray-scale image transformed from malware is input into the model combined with the DEAM and DenseNet for malware detection, and then the family classification is carried out. The DEAM is a general lightweight attention module improved based on the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), which can strengthen the attention to the characteristics of malware and improve the model effect. We use the MalImg dataset, Microsoft malware classification challenge dataset (BIG 2015), and our dataset constructed by the two above-mentioned datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model in family classification and malware detection. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 99.3% in terms of accuracy for malware detection on our dataset and achieves 98.5% and 97.3% in terms of accuracy for family classification on the MalImg dataset and BIG 2015 dataset, respectively. The model can reliably detect IoT malware and classify its families.

565. Malware Detection Using Frequency Domain-Based Image Visualization and Deep Learning
Abstract:
We propose a novel method to detect and visualize malware through image classification. The executable binaries are represented as grayscale images obtained from the count of N-grams (N=2) of bytes in the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain and a neural network is trained for malware detection. A shallow neural network is trained for classification, and its accuracy is compared with deep-network architectures such as ResNet that are trained using transfer learning. Neither dis-assembly nor behavioral analysis of malware is required for these methods. Motivated by the visual similarity of these images for different malware families, we compare our deep neural network models with standard image features like GIST descriptors to evaluate the performance. A joint feature measure is proposed to combine different features using error analysis to get an accurate ensemble model for improved classification performance. A new dataset called MaleX which contains around 1 million malware and benign Windows executable samples is created for large-scale malware detection and classification experiments. Experimental results are quite promising with 96% binary classification accuracy on MaleX. The proposed model is also able to generalize well on larger unseen malware samples and the results compare favorably with state-of-the-art static analysis-based malware detection algorithms.

576. Malware Classification with Improved Convolutional Neural Network Model
Abstract:
Malware is a threat to people in the cyber world. It steals personal information and harms computer systems. Various developers and information security specialists around the globe continuously work on strategies for detecting malware. From the last few years, machine learning has been investigated by many researchers for malware classification. The existing solutions require more computing resources and are not efficient for datasets with large numbers of samples. Using existing feature extractors for extracting features of images consumes more resources. This paper presents a Convolutional Neural Network model with pre-processing and augmentation techniques for the classification of malware gray-scale images. An investigation is conducted on the Malimg dataset, which contains 9339 gray-scale images. The dataset created from binaries of malware belongs to 25 different families. To create a precise approach and considering the success of deep learning techniques for the classification of raising the volume of newly created malware, we proposed CNN and Hybrid CNN+SVM model. The CNN is used as an automatic feature extractor that uses less resource and time as compared to the existing methods. Proposed CNN model shows (98.03%) accuracy which is better than other existing CNN models namely VGG16 (96.96%), ResNet50 (97.11%) InceptionV3 (97.22%), Xception (97.56%). The execution time of the proposed CNN model is significantly reduced than other existing CNN models. The proposed CNN model is hybridized with a support vector machine. Instead of using Softmax as activation function, SVM performs the task of classifying the malware based on features extracted by the CNN model. The proposed fine-tuned model of CNN produces a well-selected features vector of 256 Neurons with the FC layer, which is input to SVM. Linear SVC kernel transforms the binary SVM classifier into multi-class SVM, which classifies the malware samples using the one-against-one method and delivers the accuracy of 99.59%.

583. USING TRANSFER LEARNING FOR MALWARE CLASSIFICATION
Abstract:
Abstract. In this paper, we propose a malware classification framework using transfer learning based on existing Deep Learning models that have been pre-trained on massive image datasets. In recent years there has been a significant increase in the number and variety of malwares, which amplifies the need to improve automatic detection and classification of the malwares. Nowadays, neural network methodology has reached a level that may exceed the limits of previous machine learning methods, such as Hidden Markov Models and Support Vector Machines (SVM). As a result, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown superior performance compared to traditional learning techniques, specifically in tasks such as image classification. Motivated by this success, we propose a CNN-based architecture for malware classification. The malicious binary files are represented as grayscale images and a deep neural network is trained by freezing the pre-trained VGG16 layers on the ImageNet dataset and adapting the last fully connected layer to the malware family classification. Our evaluation results show that our approach is able to achieve an average of 98% accuracy for the MALIMG dataset.

585. Multi-Loss Siamese Neural Network With Batch Normalization Layer for Malware Detection
Abstract:
Malware detection is an essential task in cyber security. As the trend of malicious attacks grows, unknown malware detection with high accuracy becomes more and more challenging. The current deep learning-based approaches for malware detection are typically trained with large amounts of samples using labeled and existing malware families in the training set, thus, their capability to detect new unseen malware (such as a zero-day attack) is limited. To address this issue, we propose a new one-shot model called “Multi-Loss Siamese Neural Network with Batch Normalization Layer” that can work with fewer samples while providing high detection accuracy. Our model utilizes the Siamese Neural Network to detect new variants of malware that is trained with only a few samples. Our model is equipped with batch normalization and multiple loss functions to address the overfitting issue, due to the use of small samples, that can create the vanishing gradient problem as a result of binary cross-entropy loss, and feature embedding space to improve the detection accuracy. In addition, we illustrate a way to convert raw binary files into malware gray scale images, to work with the popular Siamese Neural Network by generating the positive and negative pairs for training. Our experimental results show that our model outperforms existing similar methods.

590. A survey on practical adversarial examples for malware classifiers
Abstract:
Machine learning based solutions have been very helpful in solving problems that deal with immense amounts of data, such as malware detection and classification. However, deep neural networks have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, or inputs that have been purposefully perturbed to result in an incorrect label. Researchers have shown that this vulnerability can be exploited to create evasive malware samples. However, many proposed attacks do not generate an executable and instead generate a feature vector. To fully understand the impact of adversarial examples on malware detection, we review practical attacks against malware classifiers that generate executable adversarial malware examples. We also discuss current challenges in this area of research, as well as suggestions for improvement and future research directions.

596. Generative Adversarial Network for Global Image-Based Local Image to Improve Malware Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network
Abstract:
Malware detection and classification methods are being actively developed to protect personal information from hackers. Global images of malware (in a program that includes personal information) can be utilized to detect or classify it. This method is efficient, given that small changes in the program can be detected while maintaining the overall structure of the program. However, if any obfuscation approach that encrypts malware code is implemented, it becomes difficult to extract features such as opcodes and application programming interface functions. Given that malware detection and classification are performed differently depending on whether malware is obfuscated or not, methods that can simultaneously detect and classify general and obfuscated malware are required. This paper proposes a method that uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) and global image-based local image to classify unobfuscated and obfuscated malware. Global and local images of unobfuscated malware are generated using pixel and local feature visualizers. The GAN is utilized to visualize local features and generate local images of obfuscated malware by learning global and local images of unobfuscated malware. The local image of unobfuscated malware is merged with the global image generated via the pixel visualizer. To merge the global and local images of unobfuscated and obfuscated malware, the pixels extracted from global and local images are stored in a two-dimensional array, and then merged images are generated. Finally, unobfuscated and obfuscated malware are classified using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The results of experiments conducted on the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (BIG 2015) dataset indicate that the proposed method has a malware classification accuracy of 99.65%, which is 2.18% higher than that of the malware classification approach based on only global images and local features.

603. From Blue-Sky to Practical Adversarial Learning
Abstract:
The state-of-the-art of adversarial machine learning on malware detection systems generally yield unexecutable samples. In this work, we make the case for understanding the robustness of visualization-based malware detection system against adversarial examples (AEs) that not only are able to fool models, but also maintain the executability of the original input. To motivate for our vision, we first investigate the application of existing off-the-shelf adversarial attack approaches on malware detection systems through which we found that those approaches do not necessarily maintain the functionality of the original inputs. Then, we discuss an approach for achieving a high misclassification rate and maintaining the executability and functionality of the original input. We use visualization-based malware detection as an example to highlight the gap between blue-sky research that focuses on aspect of the learning process, and call for more practical techniques that respect the semantics of the underlying applications.

Attention mechanism has made great progress in the field of natural language processing. At the same time, there are many research studies based on malicious code API, which is also like semantic information. It is a worthy study to apply attention mechanism to API semantics. In this paper, we firstly study the characters of the API execution sequence and classify them into 17 categories. Secondly, we propose a novel feature extraction method based on API execution sequence according to its semantics and structure information. Thirdly, based on the API data characteristics and attention mechanism features, we construct a detection framework SLAM based on local attention mechanism and sliding window method. Experiments show that our model achieves a better performance, which is a higher accuracy of 0.9723.

611. A Multiclass Detection System for Android Malicious Apps Based on Color Image Features
Abstract:
The visual recognition of Android malicious applications (Apps) is mainly focused on the binary classification using grayscale images, while the multiclassification of malicious App families is rarely studied. If we can visualize the Android malicious Apps as color images, we will get more features than using grayscale images. In this paper, a method of color visualization for Android Apps is proposed and implemented. Based on this, combined with deep learning models, a multiclassifier for the Android malicious App families is implemented, which can classify 10 common malicious App families. In order to better understand the behavioral characteristics of malicious Apps, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis for a large number of malicious Apps and summarize 1695 malicious behavior characteristics as customized features. Compared with the App classifier based on the grayscale visualization method, it is verified that the classifier using the color visualization method can achieve better classification results. We use four types of Android App features: classes.dex file, sets of class names, APIs, and customized features as input for App visualization. According to the experimental results, we find out that using the customized features as the color visualization input features can achieve the highest detection accuracy rate, which is 96% in the ten malicious families.

Abstract:
The amount of malware increases exponentially every day and poses a threat to networks and operating systems. Most new malware is a variant of existing malware. It is difficult to deal with numerous malware variants since they bypass the existing signature-based malware detection method. Thus, research on automated methods of detecting and processing variant malware has been continuously conducted. This report proposes a method of extracting feature data from files and detecting malware using machine learning. Feature data were extracted from 7,000 malware and 3,000 benign files using static and dynamic malware analysis tools. A malware classification model was constructed using multiple DNN, XGBoost, and RandomForest layers and the performance was analyzed. The proposed method achieved up to 96.3% accuracy.

Abstract:
In recent years, with the development of the Internet, information security has become the focus of our attention. With the advent of the era of big data, the detection of large-scale malicious code has attracted a lot of researches' attention. For solving the problem, we propose a malware detection method based on operation and data flow of instructions, which is used by malicious code.

And through these experiments, it is proved that this kind of rgb image, which is generated by the fusion of the operation and data flow of instructions used by malware, could be well applied to the detection of malicious code. The experiment shows that the highest detection accuracy could be as high as 97.95% and the false positive rate could be as low as 2.618%.

651. FastText-Based Local Feature Visualization Algorithm for Merged Image-Based Malware Classification Framework for Cyber Security and Cyber Defense
Abstract:
The importance of cybersecurity has recently been increasing. A malware coder writes malware into normal executable files. A computer is more likely to be infected by malware when users have easy access to various executables. Malware is considered as the starting point for cyber-attacks; thus, the timely detection, classification and blocking of malware are important. Malware visualization is a method for detecting or classifying malware. A global image is visualized through binaries extracted from malware. The overall structure and behavior of malware are considered when global images are utilized. However, the visualization of obfuscated malware is tough, owing to the difficulties encountered when extracting local features. This paper proposes a merged image-based malware classification framework that includes local feature visualization, global image-based local feature visualization, and global and local image merging methods. This study introduces a fastText-based local feature visualization method: First, local features such as opcodes and API function names are extracted from the malware; second, important local features in each malware family are selected via the term frequency inverse document frequency algorithm; third, the fastText model embeds the selected local features; finally, the embedded local features are visualized through a normalization process. Malware classification based on the proposed method using the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge dataset was experimentally verified. The accuracy of the proposed method was approximately 99.65%, which is 2.18% higher than that of another contemporary global image-based approach.

654. Malware Detection Using Gist Features and Deep Neural Network
Abstract:
Malware is a virus file which causes damage to system files like executable files, documents, program files. This intent affects the performance of the system. Malware detection is vital with occurrence of malicious code on the internet and it provides an early warning for the computer security regarding malware and cyber-attacks. Real time malware detection is still a challenge though there is a considerable research showing advances in methods that can automatically predict the malicious of a specific file, program. Though the existing malware scanner can recognize the infected file, it produces the conflicting decisions and the accuracy of prediction is still not promising. Hence it is proposed to develop an accurate malware identification model using intelligent learning method. In this paper, malware detection problem is formulated as binary classification task and appropriate solution is obtained using machine learning. A database consisting of 400 executable files of which 200 virus samples and 200 benign samples have been used to prepare the training dataset. All the executable files have been converted into gray scale images from which the GIST features are derived. The contemporary deep learning is adopted to build the binary classifier which takes the GIST features as input. The experimental results provide an accuracy of over 81% in discriminating malware and benign files. It is reported that deep neural network based binary classification achieved improved predictive performance when compared with supervised learning.

657. Malicious Code Variant Detection : A Survey
Abstract:
Malicious codes have become one of the major threats to computer systems. The malicious software which is also referred to as malware is designed by the attackers and can change their code as they propagate. The existing defense against malware is highly affected by the diversity and volume of malware variants that are being created rapidly. The variants of malware families exhibit typical behavioral patterns exhibiting their origin and purpose. The behavioral patterns can be exploited statically or dynamically to detect and classify malware into their known families. This paper provides a detailed survey of techniques to detect and classify malware into their respective families.

658. Polymorphic Malware Detection by Image Conversion Technique
Abstract:
This model implements ways to detect polymorphic malware. This model uses a dynamic approach to detect the polymorphic malware. The objective is to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the detection as this malware can morph themselves, making it difficult to trace through anti-malware systems. As the tracing is going to be difficult the detection and classification system needs to be flexible that can able to detect the malware in every possible environment. This objective can be achieved by giving the system a superintelligence, this can be done by using the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in our system. This method records the pattern or the traces made by the polymorphic malware. The pattern is in the form of the image which is formed by converting the binary format of the hash codes. The generated images are then sent to the training module, based on this training module the Convolutional Neural Networks gives the result for any testing data.

664. MDEA: Malware Detection with Evolutionary Adversarial Learning
Abstract:
Malware detection have used machine learning to detect malware in programs. These applications take in raw or processed binary data to neural network models to classify as benign or malicious files. Even though this approach has proven effective against dynamic changes, such as encrypting, obfuscating and packing techniques, it is vulnerable to specific evasion attacks where that small changes in the input data cause misclassification at test time. This paper proposes a new approach: MDEA, an Adversarial Malware Detection model uses evolutionary optimization to create attack samples to make the network robust against evasion attacks. By retraining the model with the evolved malware samples, its performance improves a significant margin.

671. The Image Game: Exploit Kit Detection Based on Recursive Convolutional Neural Networks
Abstract:
Malware has been installed through drive-by downloads via exploit kit attacks. However, the prior signature- or dynamic-based detection approach to the continuously increasing number of suspicious samples is time-consuming. In such circumstances, convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) can help in rapid detection owing to their direct image-feature generation using exploit codes. However, the general ConvNet model entails the vanishing gradient problem, where the features used for a deep learning-based detection method will become less effective as the network is deepened to improve detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a multiclass ConvNet model to classify exploit kits, where we adopt various image processing techniques and adjust the size and other parameters of images. The proposed ConvNet model recursively updates images and is designed for fully preserving image properties. This model updates the output of feature maps and pooling using an original image. This model was tested using 36,863 real-world datasets, achieving a 98.2% accuracy in exploit kit detection and family classification. Most importantly, the proposed model is 38 times faster than previous machine learning models, and training time is reduced by 77.8% when compared with prior well-known ConvNet models.

676. A Deep Learning Framework for Malware Classification
Abstract:
In this article, the authors propose a deep learning framework for malware classification. There has been a huge increase in the volume of malware in recent years which poses serious security threats to financial institutions, businesses, and individuals. In order to combat the proliferation of malware, new strategies are essential to quickly identify and classify malware samples. Nowadays, machine learning approaches are becoming popular for malware classification. However, most of these approaches are based on shallow learning algorithms (e.g. SVM). Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a deep learning approach, have shown superior performance compared to traditional learning algorithms, especially in tasks such as image classification. Inspired by this, the authors propose a CNN-based architecture to classify malware samples. They convert malware binaries to grayscale images and subsequently train a CNN for classification. Experiments on two challenging malware classification datasets, namely Malimg and Microsoft, demonstrate that their method outperforms competing state-of-the-art algorithms.

677. GDOM: Granulometry for the Detection of Obfuscated Malware
Abstract:
Abstract We describe the results of a master's thesis in malware detection and discuss the connection to the learning goals of the project. As part of the thesis, we studied obfuscation of malware, conversion of files into images, image processing, and machine learning, a process of benefit to both the student and faculty. Malware detection becomes significantly more difficult when the malicious specimen is obfuscated or transformed in an attempt to avoid detection. However, computer files have been shown to exhibit evidence of structure when converted into images, so with image processing filters such as granulometry, it is possible to generate a set of features which will help characterize malicious and non-malicious files. If the structures of file-derived images are resistant to obfuscation, these images may be of valuable use in providing malware signatures. We explore image generated file features and their effectiveness to identify malware when used with various machine learning classifiers.

Abstract:
The generative adversarial network (GAN) had been successfully applied in many domains in the past, the GAN network provides a new approach for solving computer vision, object detection and classification problems by learning, mimicking and generating any distribution of data. One of the difficulties in deep learning-based malware detection and classification tasks is lacking of training malware samples. With insufficient training data the classification performance of the deep model could be compromised significantly. To solve this issue, in this paper, we propose a method which uses the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate synthetic malware samples. Our experiment results show that by using the DCGAN generated adversarial synthetic malware samples, the classification accuracy of the classifier – a 18-layer deep residual network is significantly improved by approximately 6%.

686. Enhanced Secure Solution for PoS Architecture
Abstract:
Today retail businesses expect to bring the utmost in sales and payment transactions by adapting new technologies. Therefore, Advanced Point of Sales (PoS) Systems are widely used in the industry. Regardless of how efficient and secure these systems or applications work, unexpected information security risks can arise. Such risks could be a threat to their business and organization. It is important to ensure that critical information such as payment card information, handled in PoS systems is kept secure from attacks that could bring financial loss. This research provides a solution by studying the overall infrastructure of a PoS System and identifies the key events that such data would be at risk. The major concern of it was to enhance the existing security features of the system to avoid any type of malicious activity. This research consists of four main sections under security related to PoS Systems that would address the risk; Studying of malware and classifying them, detecting possible attacks and means of preventing it, a robot (BOT) to predict and generate the system status with a Data Leakage Prevention(DLP) solution for all the events occurring at a PoS. The key objective of implementing this solution was to protect the confidential data that is being used in the PoS System and to avoid threats that lead to the unavailability of the system. The implemented security features using machine learning and Deep Learning methods to the existing PoS functions produced a 99.3% of accuracy in Malware Detection and 95% of accuracy in its Classification process while the DLP Solution was able to obtain an accuracy of 84.6%. The above results retrieved fulfilled the research objectives and aided to integrate an enhanced security solution for a PoS system.

687. HIT4Mal: Hybrid image transformation for malware classification
Abstract:
Modern malware evolves various detection avoidance techniques to bypass the state‐of‐the‐art detection methods. An emerging trend to deal with this issue is the combination of image transformation and machine learning models to classify and detect malware. However, existing works in this field only perform simple image transformation methods. These simple transformations have not considered color encoding and pixel rendering techniques on the performance of machine learning classifiers. In this article, we propose a novel approach to encoding and arranging bytes from binary files into images. These developed images contain statistical (eg, entropy) and syntactic artifacts (eg, strings), and their pixels are filled up using space‐filling curves. Thanks to these features, our encoding method surpasses existing methods demonstrated by extensive experiments. In particular, our proposed method achieved 93.01% accuracy using the combination of the entropy encoding and character class scheme on the Hilbert curve.

Abstract:
The explosive growth of malware variants poses a continuously and deeply evolving challenge to information security. Traditional malware detection methods require a lot of manpower. However, machine learning has played an important role on malware classification and detection, and it is easily spoofed by malware disguising to be benign software by employing self-protection techniques, which leads to poor performance for existing techniques based on the machine learning method. In this paper, we analyze the local maliciousness about malware and implement an anti-interference detection framework based on API fragments, which uses the LSTM model to classify API fragments and employs ensemble learning to determine the final result of the entire API sequence. We present our experimental results on Ali-Tianchi contest API databases. By comparing with the experiments of some common methods, it is proved that our method based on local maliciousness has better performance, which is a higher accuracy rate of 0.9734.

Abstract:
Nowadays attackers work hard to develop efficient cyberthreats and exploit new techniques. So defenders need to use advanced methodologies to combat the latest threats and safely remove them from computers, mobiles and connected devices. Without the intelligent techniques, these devices would be at increased risk of damage from malicious programs. Recently a novel approach of processing malwares was appeared; it passes from malware binaries into malware images. Researchers found similarities in malwares images by extracting specific features. This paper presents malwares classifier using KNN and malware visualization technique. We used a database of 9339 samples of malwares from 25 families. We calculated the GIST descriptor for grayscale malware images. Then a KNN model was trained and evaluated many times to reach a score of 97%, which is very close to results found on literature.

Modern malware evolves various detection avoidance techniques to bypass the state-of-the-art detection methods. An emerging trend to deal with this issue is the combination of image transformation and machine learning techniques to classify and detect malware. However, existing works in this field only perform simple image transformation methods that limit the accuracy of the detection. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to classify malware by using a deep network on images transformed from binary samples. In particular, we first develop a novel hybrid image transformation method to convert binaries into color images that convey the binary semantics. The images are trained by a deep convolutional neural network that later classifies the test inputs into benign or malicious categories. Through the extensive experiments, our proposed method surpasses all baselines and achieves 99.14% in terms of accuracy on the testing set.

724. Homology analysis of malware based on ensemble learning and multifeatures
Abstract:
With the exponential increase in malware, homology analysis has become a hot research topic in the malware detection field. This paper proposes MHAS, a malware homology analysis system based on ensemble learning and multifeatures. MHAS generates grayscale images from malware binary files and then uses the opcode tool IDA Pro to extract opcode sequences and system call graphs. Thus, RGB images and M-images are generated on the image matrix. Then, MHAS uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as base learners to perform bagging ensemble learning to learn features from the grayscale images, RGB images and M-images. Next, MHAS integrates the nine base learners using voting, learning and selective ensemble (in that order) and maps the integration results to the result matrix. Finally, the result matrix is again integrated using the learning method to obtain the final malware classification result. To verify the accuracy of MHAS, we performed a malware family classification experiment, that included samples of 10 malware families. The results showed that MHAS can reach an accuracy rate of 99.17%, meaning that it can effectively analyze and identify malware families.

Abstract:
Majority of the advancement in Deep learning (DL) has occurred in domains such as computer vision, and natural language processing, where abundant training data is available. A major obstacle in leveraging DL techniques for malware analysis is the lack of sufficiently big, labeled datasets. In this paper, we take the first steps towards building a model which can synthesize labeled dataset of malware images using GAN. Such a model can be utilized to perform data augmentation for training a classifier. Furthermore, the model can be shared publicly for community to reap benefits of dataset without sharing the original dataset. First, we show the underlying idiosyncrasies of malware images and why existing data augmentation techniques as well as traditional GAN training fail to produce quality artificial samples. Next, we propose a new method for training GAN where we explicitly embed prior domain knowledge about the dataset into the training procedure. We show improvements in training stability and sample quality assessed on different metrics. Our experiments show substantial improvement on baselines and promise for using such a generative model for malware visualization systems.

744. A New Classification Based Model for Malicious PE Files Detection
Abstract:
— Malware presents a major threat to the security of computer systems, smart devices, and applications. It can also endanger sensitive data by modifying or destroying them. Thus, electronic exchanges through different communicating entities can be compromised. However, currently used signature-based methods cannot provide accurate detection of zero-day attacks, polymorphic and metamorphic programs which have the ability to change their code during propagation. In order to solve this issue, static and dynamic malware analysis is being used along with machine learning algorithms for malware detection and classification. Machine learning methods play an important role in automated malware detection. Several approaches have been applied to classify and to detect malware. The most challenging task is selecting a relevant set of features from a large dataset so that the classification model can be built in less time with higher accuracy. The purpose of this work is firstly to make a general review on the existing classification and detection meth-ods, and secondly to develop an automated system to detect malicious Portable Executable files based on their headers with low performance and more efficiency. Experimental results will be presented for the best classifier selected in this study, namely Random Forest; accuracy and time performance will be discussed

746. Robustness Analysis of CNN-based Malware Family Classification Methods Against Various Adversarial Attacks
Abstract:
As malware family classification methods, image-based classification methods have attracted much attention. Especially, due to the fast classification speed and the high classification accuracy, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based malware family classification methods have been studied. However, previous studies on CNN-based classification methods focused only on improving the classification accuracy of malware families. That is, previous studies did not consider the cases that the accuracy of CNN-based malware classification methods can be decreased under the existence of adversarial attacks. In this paper, we analyze the robustness of various CNN-based malware family classification models under adversarial attacks. While adding imperceptible non-random perturbations to the input image, we measured how the accuracy of the CNN-based malware family classification model can be affected. Also, we showed the influence of three significant visualization parameters(i.e., the size of input image, dimension of input image, and conversion color of a special character)on the accuracy variation under adversarial attacks. From the evaluation results using the Microsoft malware dataset, we showed that even the accuracy over 98% of the CNN-based malware family classification method can be decreased to less than 7%.

757. Generation & Evaluation of Adversarial Examples for Malware Obfuscation
Abstract:
There has been an increased interest in the application of convolutional neural networks for image based malware classification, but the susceptibility of neural networks to adversarial examples allows malicious actors to evade classifiers. Adversarial examples are usually generated by adding small perturbations to the input that are unrecognizable to humans, but the same approach is not effective with malware. In general, these perturbations cause changes in the byte sequences that change the initial functionality or result in un-executable binaries. We present a generative model for executable adversarial malware examples using obfuscation that achieves a high misclassification rate, up to 100% and 98% in white-box and black-box settings respectively, and demonstrates transferability. We further evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method by reporting insignificant change in the evasion rate of our adversarial examples against popular defense strategies.

Abstract:
Identification and detection of malware is important in private and government agencies for defending against cyber attack on network security. Current methods for malware analysis achieves promising results using linear methods, such as, PCA. It is well-known that the underlying physical processes behind malware binaries to image conversion are highly nonlinear. Our work set out to understand the impact of malware image resolution on suitable neighborhood size over which to consider pattern phenomena, if nonlinear methods capture pattern phenomena with increased efficacy, and how they improve clustering and identification of malware. In real-life use cases, good clustering practice requires scientific and domain knowledge. As there is no rich domain history of malware image data, we set out to explore different clustering methods with reasoning. Image domains are typically high-dimensional and can have many instantiations. For this reason, statistical approaches to clustering can fail because low probability mass is associated with a single image. Moreover, related images will therefore have subtle differences as measured by their probabilities. We developed an information theoretic method for measurement of malware image resolutions and found that nonlinear methods are better in capturing underlying data regularity and give statistically significant improvement in clustering results than linear methods. This is the first application of nonlinear Manifold learning to malware image analysis in the research literature.

786. Android Malware Detection Using Machine Learning on Image Patterns
Abstract:
Android platform has been targeted by cyber-criminals due to the increase number of Android users in 2017. More than 8,000 Android malware were identified everyday making it is difficult for the malware analyst to detect them. Traditional malware detection techniques are no longer reliable to detect newly created malware in short period of time. In this paper, we use a different approach to detect Android malware. The Android malware will be visualised into gray scale images and their image features will be extracted using GIST descriptor. The detection will be done and compare using three different classifiers namely k-nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT).

790. Eventpad: Rapid Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering using Visual Analytics
Abstract:
Forensic analysis of malware activity in network environments is a necessary yet very costly and time consuming part of incident response. Vast amounts of data need to be screened, in a very labor-intensive process, looking for signs indicating how the malware at hand behaves inside e.g., a corporate network. We believe that data reduction and visualization techniques can assist security analysts in studying behavioral patterns in network traffic samples (e.g., PCAP). We argue that the discovery of patterns in this traffic can help us to quickly understand how intrusive behavior such as malware activity unfolds and distinguishes itself from the rest of the traffic.In this paper we present a case study of the visual analytics tool EventPad and illustrate how it is used to gain quick insights in the analysis of PCAP traffic using rules, aggregations, and selections. We show the effectiveness of the tool on real-world data sets involving office traffic and ransomware activity.

801. Unmasking Android Obfuscation Tools Using Spatial Analysis
Abstract:
Android has become one of the most popular mo-bile device operating systems. Indeed, its security issues have attracted a lot of attention. One of the major security concerns is the use of obfuscation strategies to evade anti-malware solutions. Android malware authors are increasingly using code obfuscation tools and techniques to hide malicious code. In this work, we in- troduce a novel fingerprinting approach for Android obfuscation tools based on spatial analysis. We investigate first-order and second-order statistical features to analyze spatial distribution of pixels representing Android binary images. With our approach, we are able to achieve nearly 90% accuracy in fingerprinting several obfuscation tools with specific configuration options.

804. The Impact of Lightweight Disassembler on Malware Detection: An Empirical Study
Abstract:
Malicious software poses serious threats to our lives, and the activity to detect malware is becoming more and more important. An effective approach is to train a classifier using known software samples and malware samples, and recognize malware from new software. To do that, a recent popular trend is to use OpCode, which is extracted from executable modules, as an expression of software entities to drive machine learning. However, we found that the effectiveness of such a framework highly suffers from having insufficient samples, which is caused by the low success rate of disassembly due to the intrinsic complexity of the problem. In this paper, we propose to increase the success rate of disassembly by allowing inaccurate disassembling, with the attempt to increase the number of successful disassembled samples to improve OpCode-driven malware detection. We built a lightweight disassembler D-light based on the linear swap disassembly method to avoid known issues with the recursive descent manner of IDA Pro. We carried out experiment to evaluate the performance, effectiveness, and other design factors of adopting D-light and IDA Pro as disassemblers for malware detection. The empirical study shows the D-light is both more efficient and more effective than IDA Pro in supporting malware detection.

879. A multi-task learning model for malware classification with useful file access pattern from API call sequence
Abstract:
Based on API call sequences, semantic-aware and machine learning (ML) based malware classifiers can be built for malware detection or classification. Previous works concentrate on crafting and extracting various features from malware binaries, disassembled binaries or API calls via static or dynamic analysis and resorting to ML to build classifiers. However, they tend to involve too much feature engineering and fail to provide interpretability. We solve these two problems with the recent advances in deep learning: 1) RNN-based autoencoders (RNN-AEs) can automatically learn low-dimensional representation of a malware from its raw API call sequence. 2) Multiple decoders can be trained under different supervisions to give more information, other than the class or family label of a malware. Inspired by the works of document classification and automatic sentence summarization, each API call sequence can be regarded as a sentence. In this paper, we make the first attempt to build a multi-task malware learning model based on API call sequences. The model consists of two decoders, one for malware classification and one for $\emph{file access pattern}$ (FAP) generation given the API call sequence of a malware. We base our model on the general seq2seq framework. Experiments show that our model can give competitive classification results as well as insightful FAP information.

926. Android Malware Detection Through CNN Ensemble Learning on Grayscale Images
Abstract:
—With Android’s widespread adoption as the leading mobile operating system, it has become a prominent target for malware attacks. Many of these attacks employ advanced obfuscation techniques, rendering traditional detection methods, such as static and dynamic analysis, less effective. Image-based approaches provide an alternative for effective detection that addresses some limitations of conventional methods. This research introduces a novel image-based framework for Android malware detection. Using the CICMalDroid 2020 dataset, Dalvik Executable (DEX) files from Android Package (APK) files are extracted and converted into grayscale images, with dimensions scaled according to file size to preserve structural characteristics. Various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are then employed to classify benign and malicious applications, with performance further enhanced through a weighted voting ensemble optimized by Bayesian Optimization to balance the contribution of each model. An ablation study was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the six-model ensemble, showing consistent improvements in accuracy as models were added incrementally, culminating in the highest accuracy of 99.3%. This result surpasses previous research benchmarks in Android malware detection, validating the robustness and efficiency of the proposed methodology.

927. Enhancing Malware Detection Resilience: A U-Net GAN Denoising Framework for Image-Based Classification
Abstract:
: The growing complexity of cyber threats requires innovative machine learning techniques, and image-based malware classification opens up new possibilities. Meanwhile, existing research has largely overlooked the impact of noise and obfuscation techniques commonly employed by malware authors to evade detection, and there is a critical gap in using noise simulation as a means of replicating real-world malware obfuscation techniques and adopting denoising framework to counteract these challenges. This study introduces an image denoising technique based on a U-Net combined with a GAN framework to address noise interference and obfuscation challenges in image-based malware analysis. The proposed methodology addresses existing classification limitations by introducing noise addition, which simulates obfuscated malware, and denoising strategies to restore robust image representations. To evaluate the approach, we used multiple CNN-based classifiers to assess noise resistance across architectures and datasets, measuring significant performance variation. Our denoising technique demonstrates remarkable performance improvements across two multi-class public datasets, MALIMG and BIG-15. For example, the MALIMG classification accuracy improved from 23.73% to 88.84% with denoising applied after Gaussian noise injection, demonstrating robustness. This approach contributes to improving malware detection by offering a robust framework for noise-resilient classification in noisy conditions.

928. EK-Means: Towards Making Ensemble K-Means Work for Image-Based Data Analysis Without Prior Knowledge of K
Abstract:
: Despite its widespread application, K -means is significantly constrained by its dependence on the prior knowledge and its limitations in handling irregular data patterns, which restrict its performance in practical scenarios such as malware detection. To address these shortcomings, a novel EK-means algorithm is proposed. It introduces a dynamic cluster adaptation strategy (DCAS) to leverage similarity and separation measures in the pre-clustering phase to enable adaptive splitting and merging of clusters. The continuous refinement of cluster compactness and centroid representativeness in this approach facilitates the discovery of clusters with arbitrary shapes and the automatic discovery of the true number of clusters. Experimental results show that EK-means achieves high clustering accuracy across multiple datasets, including Fashion-MNIST, Virus MNIST, BIG 2015, and Malimg. It notably excels in malware detection tasks, outperforming some existing mainstream K -means enhancement methods.

939. Vision Based Malware Classification Using Deep Neural Network with Hybrid Data Augmentation
Abstract:
: Preventing malware attacks is crucial, as they can lead to financial losses, privacy breaches, system downtime, and reputational damage. Various machine learning and deep learning techniques have been proposed for malware classification. However, to evade detection, files from the same family are often altered by malware developers using various approaches so that they appear to be separate files. They may even appear as previously unidentified, commonly referred to as zero-day threats. These attacks can compromise the robustness of deep learning models trained for malware classification. In this research, we developed six fine-tuned Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifiers for classifying malware represented as images. A hybrid data augmentation technique based on Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and traditional image transformation methods has been proposed to train the classifiers, enabling them to better handle malware variants. A subset of the publicly available Malimg dataset, comprising six-class and the whole dataset, were used in the experiment. Additionally, both datasets were expanded using the proposed augmentation technique to train the developed classifiers. Experimental results reveal that vision transformer-based classifiers, trained with the proposed data augmentation technique, achieve a maximum accuracy of 99.94% for six-class classification and 99.79% for 25-class classification.
